\chapter{Complex constructions}
\label{chap:13}

\section{Introduction and overview}
\label{sec:13-1}


The absolute binary distinction between coordinate and subordinate clauses is not very helpful when describing complex (i.e. multi"=clause) constructions in Palula. Instead it makes more sense to regard inter"=clausal dependence as a~continuum, as suggested by \citet[327--328]{givon2001b}, ranging from the least dependent coordinate clauses expressing cross"=event coherence through various intermediate stages~-- including chained clauses, adverbial clauses~-- to clauses with a~high degree of dependency and event integration, as exemplified in some types of complementation.



In the following sections, this gliding scale is reflected, both in the way typical functions relate to particular constructions and in the way different subtypes are being categorised within these sections. In Section \sectref{sec:13-2}, on coordination, the constructions described are to a~large extent symmetrical, whereas Section \sectref{sec:13-3} exemplifies a~type I call clause chaining. The latter shows a~higher degree of asymmetry but not enough to be labelled subordinate, and therefore an~intermediate category ``cosubordinate'' seems better suited. This naturally leads over to the structurally closely related Section \sectref{sec:13-4}, which deals with clauses with adverbial functions, themselves displaying a~continuum from a~low degree of asymmetry to clearly asymmetrical constructions involving nominalised clauses. Section \sectref{sec:13-5}, on complementation, contains the same kind of internal continuum, ranging from a~comparatively low degree of event integration to clause union. Section \sectref{sec:13-6} covers relative clauses and presents a~special analytical challenge as far as the distinction between parataxis and embedding is concerned, and here too we witness a~continuum from clauses displaying mere discourse coherence to those involving various types of nominalisation.


\section{Coordination}
\label{sec:13-2}

Although coordinators in the traditional sense of the term are used, there seem to be stronger constraints on their use than in the more familiar European languages. Perhaps the alternative strategies for coordination, such as juxtaposition, dicourse particles and suffixes, represent the more native means for conjoining phrases and sentences. However, as will be seen in the next main section (\sectref{sec:13-3}), many sequences that in English are coded with the coordinating conjunction \textit{and}, correspond to clause chaning in Palula.



In the subsections \sectref{subsec:13-2-1}--\sectref{subsec:13-2-4} I follow the semantic subdivisions and their associated terms as used and discussed by \citet{payne1985}: \textit{conjunction} (p and q), \textit{postsection} (p and not q), \textit{presection} (not p and q), \textit{disjunction} (p or q) and \textit{rejection} (not p and not q).


\subsection{Conjunction}
\label{subsec:13-2-1}

\spitzmarke{Suffixal \textit{ee}-conjoining.} A suffix \textit{-ee} is primarily used to conjoin two noun phrases, as can be seen in examples (\ref{ex:13-1})--(\ref{ex:13-3}). It is suffixed to the first constituent, following on any other word class specific inflections.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-1}
\gll hatés díi ba dúu putr-á yúul-a [fazelnuúr-ee hayaatnuúr] \\
\textsc{3sg.}rem.\textsc{acc} from \textsc{prt} two son-\textsc{pl} come.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} Fazal.Noor-\textsc{cnj} Hayat.Noor \\
\glt `He had two sons, Fazal Noor and Hayat Noor.' (B:ATI076) 

\ex
\label{ex:13-2}
\gll le bi [c̣ook-íi-ee mac̣ook-íi] aulaád \\
\textsc{3pl.dist.nom} \textsc{prt} Choke-\textsc{gn"=cnj} Machoke-\textsc{gn} descendants  \\
\glt `They are also the descendants of Choke and Machoke.' (A:ASC004)

\ex
\label{ex:13-3}
\gll [máa-ee so] mušqúl bh-íia de  \\
\textsc{1sg}-\textsc{cnj} \textsc{3msg.nom} in.agreement become-\textsc{1pl} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `He and I used to be talking freely with each other.' (A:HUA008) 
\end{exe}

Infrequently the use of this suffix is extended to the conjoining of two constituents of other kinds, such as two verb phrases that are intimately linked and expressing something symmetrical or simulteneous, as in (\ref{ex:13-4}) and (\ref{ex:13-5}) (cf. \sectref{subsec:13-4-1} for simultaneity expressed with a~Verbal Noun followed by what is possibly the same suffix \textit{-ee}). This should, however, not be seen as a~matter of sentential coordination in a~strict sense, as the verb phrases have a~subject in common.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-4}
\gll ɡíri dhiaáṛ [ráal bh-éen-i-ee nam-éen-i]  \\
big.stone rock high become-\textsc{prs-f-cnj} get.down-\textsc{prs-f}  \\
\glt `The big stone or rock is moving up and down.' (A:DRA007)

\ex
\label{ex:13-5}
\gll táa ɡíia ta ɡíri ǰhulí xaamaár [dhreéɡ de hín-u-ee níindra-m maǰí hín-u aaraám ki hín-u] \\
there go.\textsc{pfv.pl} \textsc{prt} big.stone on dragon stretched.out  give.\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs"=msg"=cnj} sleep-\textsc{ob} in be.\textsc{prs"=msg}  resting \textsc{prt} be.\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `When they came there, a~dragon was lying on top of the big stone, sleeping peacefully.' (A:DRA009-10) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Juxtaposition.} Conjunction of more than two noun phrases is often expressed by juxtaposition, in a~list"=like manner, (\ref{ex:13-6})--(\ref{ex:13-7}), but can occasionally be used with two noun phrases only, as in example (\ref{ex:13-8}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-6}
\gll ɡhireé c̣ook-íi-ee mac̣ook-íi aulaád [mirmaadikoór, mulaakoór, baḍileé, zariṇeé, phaṭakeé] \\
again Choke-\textsc{gn"=cnj} Machoke-\textsc{gn} descendants  Mirmadikor Mullahkor Badiley Zariney Phatakey \\
\glt `After that, the descendants of Choke and Machoke are Mirmadikor, Mullahkor, Badiley, Zariney, and Phatakey.' (A:ASC005)

\ex
\label{ex:13-7}
\gll ak zamaanée [ak ɡúu, miḍ, uṭ] doost-aán de \\
\textsc{idef} time.\textsc{gn} \textsc{ idef} ox ram camel friend-\textsc{pl}  be.\textsc{pst}  \\
\glt `Once upon a~time there where three friends: an~ox, a~ram and a~camel.' (B:SHI001)

\ex
\label{ex:13-8}
\gll díiš-a ba [baalbač-á kuṛíina] tamá th-éen de \\
village-\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} child-\textsc{pl} woman.\textsc{pl} waiting do-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst}  \\
\glt `In the village the children and women were waiting.' (B:AVA218) 
\end{exe}

Juxtaposition is also applied to closely interrelated verb phrases or clauses, for instance, when a~particular verbal action or event is identical for several subjects, as in (\ref{ex:13-9}), or when the verb phrases, as in (\ref{ex:13-10}), have an~identical subject as well as an~identical recipient or beneficiary. A sequence of events with the same subject, such as the one in (\ref{ex:13-11}), would in most cases be coded with clause chaining (\sectref{sec:13-3}), but for some reason, maybe reflecting how upset the speaker is, juxtaposition is used instead.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-9}
\gll aní ɡhooṣṭ-a šíiṭi [ma seé hín-u, míi kuṛi seé hín-i, míi preṣ seé hín-i] \\
\textsc{prox} house-\textsc{ob} inside \textsc{1sg.nom} sleep.\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs"=msg}  \textsc{1sg.gn} woman sleep.\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs-f } \textsc{1sg.gn} mother.in.law sleep.\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs-f} \\
\glt `Inside this house I was asleep, my wife was asleep, and my mother"=in"=law was asleep.' (A:HUA014-5)

\ex
\label{ex:13-10}
\gll [siɡréṭ ɡaḍ-í dít-i činí phuukawéel-i]  \\
cigarette take.out-\textsc{cv} give.\textsc{pfv-f} sugar make.blow.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `We offered them cigarettes and sugar.' (A:GHA060)

\ex
\label{ex:13-11}
\gll karáaṛu yhóol-u kučúr-a khóol-a  \\
leopard come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} dog-\textsc{pl} eat.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `A leopard has come and eaten the dogs.' (A:HUA020) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{The conjunction \textit{o/oór}.} A special conjunction, \textit{o} alternatively \textit{oór}, is used sparingly and sometimes in addition to other conjuction strategies. It is not wholly unlikely that they owe something to Pashto and Urdu influence, respectively, being close in form and function to the most important conjunctions in each of these languages. The latter form is, in particular, found primarily in data obtained from younger persons (in A.) and in written discourse (in B.). 


As a~conjunction between noun phrases, it is mainly found where more than two noun phrases are conjoined, as in (\ref{ex:13-12}) and (\ref{ex:13-13}), and then the position is always and only between the last two phrases.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-12}
\gll se míiš-a dúi dees-á [baačaá wazíir o dúi xálak-a] samaṭ-í ilaán thíil-i \\
\textsc{def} man-\textsc{ob} other day-\textsc{ob} king minister and other  people-\textsc{pl} gather-\textsc{cv} announcement do.\textsc{pfv-f}  \\
\glt `Next day the man called the king, the prime minister and other people together and made an~announcement.' (A:UXW060)

\ex
\label{ex:13-13}
\gll mheeríl-ii pahúrta [tasíi híṛu tasíi ǰhanɡaár oór tasíi aandáara] ɡaḍ-í khóol-a  \\
die.\textsc{pptc"=gn} after \textsc{3sg.gn} heart \textsc{3sg.gn}  liver and \textsc{3sg.gn} intestines take.out-\textsc{cv} eat.\textsc{pfv"=mpl}hín-u ki{\ldots} \\
\glt `After he had killed her, he took out her heart, her liver, and her intestines and ate them up.' (A:WOM651) 
\end{exe}

As we saw above, this kind of stringing together of several noun phrases can also be done by mere juxtaposition. In fact, when a~dialect adaptation was made (from B. to A.) of a~story that (\ref{ex:13-7}) is taken from, the same sentence was equipped with the conjunction \textit{o} between the two last noun phrases. 


A conjunction word is also used sometimes to conjoin closely interrelated verb phrases or same"=subject clauses, as the ones exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-14}) and (\ref{ex:13-15}). Often, the second proposition or phrase provides additional information about the action or event mentioned in the first. The two are sometimes but not necessarily co"=temporal.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-14}
\gll oothóon-a the nhiáaṛa phed-í ba biṣamíl-u hín-u o dun-áaṭ-u bhíl-u hín-u ki...\\
settlement-\textsc{ob} to near arrive-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} rest.\textsc{pfv"=msg} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} and think-\textsc{ag"=msg} become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} be.\textsc{prs"=msg } \textsc{comp} \\
\glt `When he came near the settlement, he rested and started to think...' (A:KAT056-7)

\ex
\label{ex:13-15}
\gll uth-í ba ɣusulxaaná the ba-yáan-u óor ɣusúl ɡhin-áan-u \\
stand.up-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} bathroom to go.\textsc{prs"=msg}  and bath take-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `When I have got up I go to the bathroom, and I take a~bath.' (B:MOR002-3) 
\end{exe}

Rather infrequently a~conjunction is also used to link two different"=subject clauses, such as the ones in (\ref{ex:13-16}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-16}
\gll nhiáaṛee ba áaṇc̣-ii áak muṭ heensíl-u hín-u o áaṇc̣-a ba pač-í šiiy-í báaiṭ-a bhíl-a hín-a \\
near \textsc{prt} raspberry-\textsc{gn} \textsc{idef} tree dwell.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  be.\textsc{prs"=msg} and raspberry-\textsc{pl} \textsc{prt} ripen-\textsc{cv} fall-\textsc{cv} go.\textsc{ag"=mpl} become.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `Nearby a~raspberry bush grew and its berries had become ripe.' (A:KAT128) 
\end{exe}

However, as far as temporal sequencing is concerned, the overwhelmingly most common ways of conjoining clauses are by using cosubordinate Converb clauses and subordinate \textit{ta}-clauses in so"=called ``clause chains'' (as described in \sectref{sec:13-3}).


There are also examples of predicate adjective phrases being thus conjoined. An example can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-17}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-17}
\gll so bíiḍ-u [uxyaár o hileéṛ] de maní  \\
\textsc{3sg.nom} very-\textsc{msg} wise and brave be.\textsc{pst} \textsc{hsay} \\
\glt `He was very wise and brave.' (A:UXB004) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Conjunction with the ``separating'' particle \textit{bi}.} An added emphasis on the separateness of two or more units conjoined is given by means of a~particle \textit{bi} (approximately `too, also'), as in examples (\ref{ex:13-18})--(\ref{ex:13-20}). It is primarily added immediately after the constituents in focus, which in most cases are noun phrases, whereas the coordination itself is sentential rather than phrasal (which is not obvious with copular clauses lacking an~overt copula, as in (\ref{ex:13-18})). The particle used this way is added after each of the conjoined constituents, rendering it `X as well as Y' or `both X and Y'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-18}
\gll ma [tarkaáṇ bi misrí bi]  \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} carpenter also mason also \\
\glt `I'm a~carpenter as well as a~mason.' (A:HOW009)

\ex
\label{ex:13-19}
\gll ma ba uth-í ba [toobaák bi heensíl-i de, khanɡaár bi heensíl-u de, ṭhónɡi bi heensíl-i de] \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{prt} stand.up-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} gun also  be.present.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{pst} sword also be.present.\textsc{pfv"=msg } \textsc{pst} axe also be.present.\textsc{pfv-f } \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `When I got up, there was a~gun, a~sword and an~axe (with me).' (A:HUA021-2)

\ex
\label{ex:13-20}
\gll pha-íi baábu ǰhaamatreé díi [xarčá bi dawiáan-u ǰandeé bi khéli dawiáan-u]  \\
girl-\textsc{gn} father son.in.law.\textsc{ob} from expenses also  ask.for.\textsc{prs"=msg} goat.\textsc{pl} also numerous ask.for.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `The girl father demands expenses (to be paid) as well as numerous goats.' (A:MAR032-3) 
\end{exe}

The particle \textit{bi} is sometimes also used in combination with the coodinating suffix \textit{-ee} (\ref{ex:13-21}) or the conjunction \textit{o} (\ref{ex:13-22}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-21}
\gll aṛé  [šišáki  bi man-áan"=ee  ruikúṛi bi man-áan-a] \\
\textsc{3fsg.dist.nom} ``shishaki'' also say-\textsc{prs"=mpl.cnj}  ``ruikuli'' also say-\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `We call her a ``shishaki'' and also a ``ruikuli''.' (A:PAS110)

\ex
\label{ex:13-22}
\gll dhrúuk-a be dac̣h-íin ta [manɡái čhoor-í hín-i o áak rumiaál bi čhoor-í hín-i]  \\
stream-\textsc{ob} go.\textsc{cv} look-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{prt} water.pot put-\textsc{cv}  be.\textsc{prs-f} and \textsc{idef } handkerchief also put-\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs-f } \\
\glt `Going to the stream they saw the water pot and a~handkerchief lying there.' (A:SHY059) 
\end{exe}

In Kohistani Shina (Ruth Schmidt, pc.; \citealt[252]{schmidtkohistani2008}) a~particle \textit{-ɡa} has a~function comparable to Palula \textit{bi}, but its scope is apparently much larger than that of the Palula particle, as it conjoins various types of phrases and clauses (much like Palula \textit{-ee}), not necessarily with an~additional ``separating'' semantics. 



\spitzmarke{Conjunction with the ``adversative'' construction \textit{ta{\ldots}ba}.} An adversative meaning with a~semantic contrast implied, translatable with `but, whereas, while' (but sometimes `and' is better still), is indicated with the use of a~particle \textit{ta} added immediately after the first constituent, and another particle \textit{ba} (with other discourse functions) after the second. As is apparent from examples (\ref{ex:13-23})--(\ref{ex:13-25}), the coordination itself is, like the use of \textit{bi,} sentential rather than phrasal.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-23}
\gll eetás [míiš-a ta ṭhak-íin de kuṛíina ba čoot-íin de] \\
\textsc{3sg.rem.acc} man-\textsc{pl} \textsc{prt} shake.down-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst} woman.\textsc{pl} \textsc{prt} pluck-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The men were shaking them [the walnuts] down, while the women were collecting them.' (A:JAN017)

\ex
\label{ex:13-24}
\gll aaɡhaá ta dhúura dharán ba ḍanɡ  \\
sky \textsc{prt} distant ground \textsc{prt} hard \\
\glt `The sky is far but/and the ground is hard.' (B:PRB009)

\ex
\label{ex:13-25}
\gll so ta bač bhíl-u trúu ǰáan-a ba hiimeel-í híṛ-a \\
\textsc{3msg.nom} \textsc{prt} saved become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} three person-\textsc{pl} \textsc{prt } glacier-\textsc{ob} take.away.\textsc{pfv"=mpl}  \\
\glt `He was saved, but three persons were taken by the avalanche.' (B:AVA214) 
\end{exe}

The construction \textit{ta{\ldots}ba} is sometimes, as in (\ref{ex:13-26}), used along with the coodinating suffix \textit{-ee}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-26}
\gll huṇḍ ta c̣híitr"=ee bhun ba ɡhaawaáz de \\
above \textsc{prt} field-\textsc{cnj} below \textsc{prt} stream.bed be.\textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The field was above and the stream"=bed below.' (A:JAN082) 
\end{exe}


\spitzmarke{Conjunction with the ``adversative'' particle \textit{xu}.} Another type of adversative, with a~denial of expectation implied, is formed with a~particle \textit{xu} (also functioning as a~marker of evidentiality).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-27}
\gll ɡhaḍeerá mána thíil-u xu so aahóola tool"=ii-eé de \\
elder.\textsc{ob} prevention do.\textsc{pfv"=msg} but \textsc{3msg.nom} repeatedly measure-\textsc{3sg"=cont}{\protect\footnotemark} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The elder one told him to stop, but he [the younger one] kept measuring.' (A:DRA019)
\end{exe}

\footnotetext{In my material this is a~rarely occurring and not yet fully classified morpheme. It
  appears, at least in this sentence, to have a~continuative meaning. Whether it is to be identified
  with the (accent"=bearing) \textit{-eé} of inclusiveness remains unanswered.}

\subsection{Presection and postsection}
\label{subsec:13-2-2}

The ``adversative'' particle \textit{xu} (see above) is also used together with the negation \textit{na} in typical sentential pre- and postsection (as defined in \sectref{sec:13-2}) constructions.


\spitzmarke{Presection with \textit{na{\ldots}xu}.} In this construction, exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-28}), the particle \textit{xu} occurs between the two conjoined parts, and the negation word \textit{na} in its regular preverbal position in the first part.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-28}
\gll se bi čúur páanǰ bhe ma na ṭinɡ th-áai bhóon de xu míi se preṣ yhayí ba c̣héeṇi ɡhin-í ǰ-íi sée$\sim$ta bhí-um de \\
\textsc{3pl.nom} even four five become.\textsc{cv} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{neg}  challenge do-\textsc{inf} be.able.\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst} but \textsc{1sg.gn}  \textsc{def} mother.in.law come.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} stick take-\textsc{cv} hit-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{condh} be.afraid-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `Even those four five people could not face me, but my mother"=in"=law came and beat me with a~stick and I became afraid.' (A:HUA123-4) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Postsection with \textit{xu{\ldots}na}.} In this construction, exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-29}), the particle \textit{xu} occurs between the two conjoined clauses or propositions, and the negation word in its regular preverbal position in the second proposition.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-29}
\gll sóon-a ba so phoó koošíš th-áan-u xu waxt milaáu na bh-áan-u \\
pasture-\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} \textsc{def.msg.nom} boy attempt   do-\textsc{prs"=msg} but time meeting \textsc{neg} become-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `In the pastures, the boy is trying, but he doesn't find the time.' (A:SHY042) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Postsection with final \textit{na}.} Postsection can also be expressed with a~sentence"=final negative particle \textit{na} , as in (\ref{ex:13-30}) and (\ref{ex:13-31}), without the aid of \textit{xu}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-30}
\gll ǰ-úum ma ṛas mhaar-úum, uṛ-úum ba na \\
hit-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{3sg.dist.acc} kill-\textsc{1sg} let.out-\textsc{1sg}
\textsc{prt} \textsc{neg} \\
\glt `I will kill it and not let it free.' (A:HUA058)

\ex
\label{ex:13-31}
\gll nam-í ta yhéel-i hée$\sim$ta ṣiṣ ḍhak-áan-u ráal ba yhéel-i hée$\sim$ta phed-áan-a na \\
lower-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} come.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{condl} head touch-\textsc{prs"=msg}  high \textsc{prt} come.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{condl} reach-\textsc{prs"=msg} \textsc{neg} \\
\glt `If it is put too low people will hit their head, but if it is put too high nobody will reach up.' (A:HOW069-70)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Disjunction}
\label{subsec:13-2-3}

\spitzmarke{Juxtaposition.} The least emphasised kind of disjunction is by mere juxtaposition, normally of two numerals (as in the juxtaposition of `four' and `five' in (\ref{ex:13-28}) above) or of two noun phrases with numeral attributes, as in (\ref{ex:13-32}), expressing an~approximate figure rather than constituting an~alternative in an~absolute sense.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-32}
\gll díiš-e xálak ǰamá bhe kir kareé ɡalé bíiḍ-u dít-u síinta [panǰ phuṭ-í ṣo phuṭ-í] kir dít-u síinta \\
village-\textsc{gn} people collection become.\textsc{cv} snow  when ever much-\textsc{msg} give.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condh} five  foot-\textsc{pl} six foot-\textsc{pl} snow give.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condh}  \\
\glt `The village people used to gather when much snow had been falling, 5 or 6 feet snow.' (B:AVA198) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Phrasal disjunction with \textit{y}\textit{áa}.} A slightly more emphasised disjunction uses \textit{yáa} between the phrases, as seen in (\ref{ex:13-33}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-33}
\gll eesé phaíi [bhroó yáa maámu] koó eesé ṭeem-íi haazír na heensíl-u hée$\sim$ta, tasíi mux-íi nikh"=eeṇḍeéu bh-áan-u \\
\textsc{rem} girl.\textsc{gn} brother or uncle who \textsc{rem} time"=gn  present \textsc{neg} stay.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condl} \textsc{3sg.gn} face-\textsc{gn}  come.out-\textsc{oblg} become-\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `If the girl's brother or her uncle wasn't present at that time, he has to be greeted.' (A:MAR047-9) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Sentential disjunction with \textit{y}\textit{áa}\textit{ba{\ldots}y}\textit{áa}\textit{ba}.} Although there are few examples, it seems a~construction with a~repeated \textit{yáa} combined with the particle \textit{ba} (probably forming one phonological word), as in (\ref{ex:13-34}), is preferred for sentential disjunction, possibly with an~added emphasis on the mutual exclusivity of the alternatives thus presented. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-34}
\gll típa šái phed-í asaám yáaba khóo yáaba na khóo \\
now thing arrive-\textsc{cv} \textsc{1pl.acc} or eat.\textsc{3sg} or \textsc{neg} eat.\textsc{3sg} \\
\glt `Now this thing will come here and it will either eat us or it will not eat us.' (A:GHA063) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Sentential and phrasal disjunction \textit{ki}.} A semantically equivalent construction presenting mutual exclusivity is also found, as in (\ref{ex:13-35})--(\ref{ex:13-36}), with a~particle \textit{ki}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-35}
\gll hasó tohfá [phedíl-u ki na phedíl-u] \\
\textsc{rem.msg.nom} gift arrive.\textsc{pfv"=msg} or \textsc{neg}  arrive.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Did this gift arrive or not?' (B:FLW817)

\ex
\label{ex:13-36}
\gll buǰ-áan-u ba na ki nu ɡa šái karáaṛu ki iṇc̣ ki nu ɡa čiíz thaní \\

\glt `I didn't understand what sort of thing this was, whether it was a~leopard or a~bear or what sort of creature.' (A:HUA038-9) 
\end{exe}

Kohistani Shina uses a~word borrowed from Punjabi, \textit{paa$\sim$wee$\sim$} `or', to express disjunction (Ruth Schmidt, pc.).


\subsection{Rejection}
\label{subsec:13-2-4}

\spitzmarke{Rejection with \textit{na{\ldots}na}.} Rejection can be expressed simply with a~phrase- or clause"=initial negation \textit{na}, as exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-37}) and (\ref{ex:13-38}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-37}
\gll na zinaawur-á tas the asár thíil-i de na ɡhrast-á thíil-i de \\
\textsc{neg} beast-\textsc{ob} \textsc{3sg.acc} to harm do.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{pst}  \textsc{neg} wolf-\textsc{ob} do.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `Neither beast nor wolf had harmed him.' (A:GHA014)

\ex
\label{ex:13-38}
\gll se na kasíi xaadí dac̣h-éen-i na kasíi marɡ dac̣héeni \\
\textsc{3fsg.nom} \textsc{neg} whose happiness look-\textsc{prs-f}  \textsc{neg} whose death look-\textsc{prs-f}  \\
\glt `She cares neither for anyone's happiness, nor for anyone's death.' (A:KEE005-6) 
\end{exe}

Two other strategies available for expressing rejection are both combinations of negation and conjunctions already discussed above.


\spitzmarke{Rejection using ``adversative'' conjunction and negation, \textit{na ta{\ldots}na ba}}. It should be noted that the word order (the particle vis-à-vis the contrasted constituent) is the reverse compared with the one found in the conjunctive construction with \textit{ta{\ldots}ba}. Examples are given in (\ref{ex:13-39}) and (\ref{ex:13-40}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-39}
\gll na ta tanaám the dít-i na ba asaám the dít-i \\
\textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} \textsc{3pl.acc} to give.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} \textsc{1pl.acc} to give.\textsc{pfv-f}  \\
\glt `Neither did they give them to them, nor to us.' (A:GHA089)

\ex
\label{ex:13-40}
\gll dúi ba na ta duwaá thíil-u na ba ɡa háanǰ-a dít-a \\
other \textsc{prt} \textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} prayer do.\textsc{pfv"=ms.g} \textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} any curse-\textsc{pl} give.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `Then, neither did he pray, nor did he utter any curses.' (A:PIR038-9) 
\end{exe}

As can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-41}), the strategy also occurs in combination with the conjunctive suffix \textit{-ee}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-41}
\gll méeǰi na ta ṣoo-íi tarapíi ɡa faaidá-ee na ba barawolxaan-íi tarapíi ɡa faaidá \\
between \textsc{neg} \textsc{prt } king-\textsc{gn} direction.\textsc{gn} any benefit-\textsc{cnj} \textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} Barawul.Khan-\textsc{gn} direction.\textsc{gn} any benefit  \\
\glt `Between them, neither was there any benefit from the king's side, nor from Barawul Khan.' (A:JAN007-8) 
\end{exe}

Rejection using ``separative'' conjunction and negation, \textit{bi na{\ldots}bi na}, is illustrated in (\ref{ex:13-42})--(\ref{ex:13-43}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-42}
\gll dac̣h-íin ta kaṭamúš bi náin-u iṇc̣ bi náin-u \\
look-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{prt} Katamosh also not.be.\textsc{prs"=msg} bear also not.be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `They saw that neither Katamosh nor the bear was there.' (A:KAT144)

\ex
\label{ex:13-43}
\gll bíiḍ-i ráal bi na th"=eeṇḍeéu naam"=eeṇḍeéu bi na \\
much-\textsc{f} high also not do-\textsc{oblg} lower-\textsc{oblg} also not  \\
\glt `It should not be raised very high, neither should it be lowered [much].' (A:HOW068) 
\end{exe}

Kohistani Shina expresses rejection with \textit{nee$\sim${\ldots}nee$\sim$} `no{\ldots}no', while the regular clause negation in this variety is \textit{na} (Ruth Schmidt, pc.).


\section{Clause chaining}
\label{sec:13-3}

One of the more salient features of Palula discourse (especially of a~narrative kind) is its use of clause chaining, thus fitting into the category ``chaining'' languages, as described by \citet[175-6]{thompsonlongacre1985} and \citet[238--239]{longacre1985}. Such clause chains express sequences of events or actions carried out and consist of one or several non"=final clauses (note the distinction made between (non-)\textit{final} and (non)\textit{finite}), followed by one final clause. Each non"=final clause is relating to the one immediately preceding it and the one following it, but not necessarily to the final clause. I have adopted the term \textit{cosubordinate} (see explanation below) to describe this type of clause linking which is somewhat intermediate between coordination and subordination.


\subsection{Same"=subject chaining}
\label{subsec:13-3-1}

In examples (\ref{ex:13-44})--(\ref{ex:13-46}), the construction used in the non"=final clauses is a~nonfinite Converb (cv), a~verb form without any participant agreement, and the subject left implicit. A literal translation of (\ref{ex:13-44}) would render something like `The father, having killed a~goat, having removed its skin, put the skin on him'. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-44}
\gll \label{bkm:Ref190770484}[baába ba yakdám bhíiru mheer-í] [tasíi púustu ɡaḍ-í] so púustu tas ṣaawóol-u  \\
father.\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} immediately he.goat kill-\textsc{cv} \textsc{3sg.gn} skin  remove-\textsc{cv} \textsc{def.msg.nom} skin \textsc{3sg.acc} put.on.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `The father killed a~he"=goat, skinned it, and put the skin on his son.' (A:DRA023)

\ex
\label{ex:13-45}
\gll ti ba [bhun whay-í ba] [so  mhaás muṭ-í bhun wheel-í ba] [teeṇíi
  ɡhooṣṭ-á the ɡhin-í] ɡáu \\
\textsc{3sg.ob} \textsc{prt} down come.down-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{def.msg.nom}  meat tree-\textsc{gn} down take.down-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{refl} house-\textsc{ob}  to take-\textsc{cv} go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \\
\glt `He came down, took down the meat from the tree, and brought it to his house.' (B:SHB762)

\ex
\label{ex:13-46}
\gll ɡhaḍeerá [phed-í] laṣ-čax [kaṭéeri ɡhin-í] se taáǰ čhiníl-i  \\
elder.\textsc{ob} arrive-\textsc{cv} swiftly knife take-\textsc{cv} \textsc{def} crown cut.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `The elder (brother) came, took a~knife, and cut off the crown.' (A:DRA016) 
\end{exe}

As pointed out by \citet[327-8]{givon2001b}, although traditional grammar has made a~binary distinction between dependent/subordinate adverbial clauses, on the one hand, and independent/coordinate main clauses, on the other, it is evident that dependency as well as subordination, is a~matter of degree rather than being descrete properties of clauses. \citet[20--27]{haspelmath1995}, following the same reasoning, suggests a \textit{cosubordinate} category intermediate between coordination and subordination, which would thus capture the status of the non"=final verbs in above"=mentioned chains, in some traditions also described as \textit{medial} verbs. Whereas the connection between a~cosubordinate clause, and another cosubordinate clause, or between a~cosubordinate clause and its corresponding main/final clause, often will have to find its translation equivalent in a~coordinate clause (for instance, in English), the non"=final clause is still to a~large extent dependent on the independent clause for its TMA specification or participant reference.



However, an~argument in favour of still viewing Converb clauses as subordinate would be that they sometimes seem to appear inside (i.e. embedded into) the final clause. Example (\ref{ex:13-44}) is ambiguous in this respect, since we can analyse the ergatively marked \textit{baába} `father', either as the explicit subject of the first non"=final transitive clause (as is suggested by the square brackets) or as the explicit subject of the final transitive clause. 



In example (\ref{ex:13-46}) on the other hand, the final clause is transitive and the first Converb is intransitive, and therefore the ergatively marked subject must be analysed as the subject of the final (and finite) verb, and therefore the first Converb clause in its entirety has to be analysed as embedded into the final clause (as is also the second Converb clause, which has an~instrumental reading, see \sectref{subsec:13-4-1}). It is at this point that clause chaining shades over into the realm of more asymmetrical adverbial functions. 



In (\ref{ex:13-45}), however, sentence"=initial \textit{ti} `he' can not be the subject (S) of the intransitive final verb `go'. Since it is marked for ergative alignment, it must be the subject (A) either of transitive \textit{whaalé-} `take down' or transitive \textit{ɡhin-} `take', both of these non"=final Converbs in this sentence. Simple embedding is therefore not really the case here, and again cosubordination seems a~suitable categorisation. 



Some overlap between medial verbs~-- as used in chained or so"=called cosubordinate clauses~-- and Converbs coding more typical adverbial functions, is indeed to be expected \citep[26]{haspelmath1995}, and we find that the very same mechanism is put to work in many clauses corresponding to distinct adverbial"=clause types (see \sectref{subsec:13-4-1}--\sectref{subsec:13-4-5}) in the familiar European languages, with a~number of semantic relationships implied between the dependent clause and the main clause. 


\subsection{Different"=subject chaining}
\label{subsec:13-3-2}


While the chaining exemplified above expresses sequencing of events or actions with one and the same subject, another construction type is being used when there is a~subject switch after a~non"=final clause: a~non"=final clause as the ones found in (\ref{ex:13-47}) and (\ref{ex:13-48}), in which a~finite verb is followed by the particle \textit{ta}, is in turn followed by another (non"=final or final) clause.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-47}
\gll eesé míiš-a ba toopaančá ɡaḍ-í [se dhuumíiy"=ii ǰít-i de ta] se dhuumíi uḍheewíl-i de \\
\textsc{rem} man-\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} pistol take.out-\textsc{cv} \textsc{def}  smoke-\textsc{gn} shoot\textsc{ pfv-f} \textsc{pst} \textsc{prt} \textsc{def} smoke flee.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `That man took out a~pistol, shot at the smoke, and the smoke disappeared.' (A:GHA052)

\ex
\label{ex:13-48}
\gll [áa deés táa ɡúum ta] máa-the qisá thíil-u \\
\textsc{idef} day there go.\textsc{pfv"=msg } \textsc{prt} \textsc{1sg.nom}-to story do.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `One day I went there, and he told me a~story.' (A:HUA009) 
\end{exe}

Sequences of two or more non"=final clauses can include same"=subject (SS) clauses as well as different"=subject (DS) clauses, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-49}) and (\ref{ex:13-50}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-49}
\gll theé aaxeríi [áa bac̣húuṛu mheer-í]\textsc{\textsubscript{ss}} [púustu ṣaawóol-u ta]\textsc{\textsubscript{ds}} bac̣húuṛ-ii púust-a ba tas ɡhašíl-u, ṭinɡ thíil-u \\
then finally \textsc{idef} calf kill-\textsc{cv}  skin  put.on.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} calf-\textsc{gn} skin-\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} \textsc{3sg.acc}
catch.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{host} do.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Then at last he killed a~calf, dressed (his son) in the skin, and the skin of the calf helped him.' (A:DRA031)

\ex
\label{ex:13-50}
\gll [thíi ak dhií paidaá bhíl-i ta]\textsc{\textsubscript{ds}} [thíi kúṛi tes ɡhin-í]\textsc{\textsubscript{ss}} [adráx ṣač-í]\textsc{\textsubscript{ss}} ɡéi \\
\textsc{2sg.gn} \textsc{idef} daughter born become.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{prt} \textsc{2sg.gn}  wife \textsc{3sg.acc} take-\textsc{cv} forest climb-\textsc{cv} go.\textsc{pfv.fsg} \\
\glt `A daughter of yours was born, your wife took her and went up into the forest.' (B:FOR014) 
\end{exe}

Note that, while the Converbs in the SS constructions do not show agreement, the verbs in the DS constructions do. In example (\ref{ex:13-49}), the Perfective verb \textit{ṣaawóolu} agrees in gender and number with the direct object \textit{púustu}). 


In a~great many cases of chaining with \textit{ta,} the non"=final clause is most naturally translatable as a `when'-clause in English, and a~number of other semantic relationships can be implied as well, the latter something that will become obvious when discussing different constructions expressing adverbial functions (\sectref{sec:13-4}). As was the case with the SS"=chaining using the Converb construction, DS"=chaining by means of the \textit{ta}-construction also shades over into even more asymmetrical and more typical adverbial functions. 


\section{Clauses with adverbial functions}
\label{sec:13-4}

The type of clauses using the Converb construction (SS) and the \textit{ta}-construction (DS) would certainly qualify as ``absolutive'' adverbial clauses according to \citeauthor{thompsonlongacre1985}'s (\citeyear[200-201]{thompsonlongacre1985}) definition, due to their wide scope and their lack of explicit signals as to the exact semantic relationship between non"=final and final clauses. Their function in the discourse is often inferred from the context. As was pointed out above, it is not always very obvious where to draw the line between such semi"=independent chained clauses and clauses that to a~larger extent are interpretable as adverbial and dependent vis-à-vis one particular main clause. 



Like non"=final chained clauses, clauses with adverbial functions generally precede their head. They usually precede the entire head clause although embedding into the head clause or head proposition also occurs quite frequently. Only rarely does the modifying clause occur subsequent to the verb of the head clause. All such clauses with adverbial functions are in essence dependent but, as was reflected earlier in the discussion on clause chaining above, not equally and unquestionably subordinate in nature. 



A number of different construction types are available for clauses functioning adverbially, some of them with a~more general application, and others more restricted to certain subfunctions:


\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] A preposed or embedded nonfinite Converb clause, in IA languages often referred to as the Conjunctive Participle Construction (also used in SS"=chains).

\item[(ii)] A preposed clause with a~finite verb followed by the grammatical particle \textit{ta} (also used in DS"=chains); infrequently together with a~clause"=introducing subordinating conjunction with a~more specific lexical content

\item[(iii)] A preposed clause with a~finite verb followed by a~conditional mood marker

\item[(iv)] A preposed Perfective Participle clause governed by a~lexically specific postposition

\item[(v)] A preposed or embedded clause with a~Verbal Noun, either occurring on its own (sometimes with a~suffix) or with a~lexically specific postposition

\item[(vi)] A pre- or postposed clause with an~Agentive Verbal Noun and a~finite form of \textit{bhe-} `become'

\item[(vii)] An embedded nonfinite clause with a~Copredicative Participle
\end{enumerate}

These constructions will be discussed as they occur in the different adverbial functions presented below. 


\subsection{Temporality and related functions}
\label{subsec:13-4-1}

\spitzmarke{Subsequence.} Many dependent clauses with an~obvious temporal reading are in fact not much different from the sequential chaining discussed above (\sectref{sec:13-3}). Especially when it is a~matter of subsequence, and the subject remains the same, the Converb construction (i) is used, as in (\ref{ex:13-51})--(\ref{ex:13-52}). Sometimes, especially in narratives, an~immediately preceding finite verb is repeated but as a~Converb, thus not adding any new information but instead highlighting the temporal relationship between the two events. This latter use of the Converb is more typically adverbial~-- and the Converb clause to a~greater extent dependent~-- than its use in sequential chaining as laid out above.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-51}
\gll (eesé zanɡal-i áa baṭ-á ǰhulí harí so kuṇaák bheešóol-u.) [bheešaá] tasíi paaṇṭí ɡaḍ-íi de \\
\textsc{rem} forest-\textsc{ob} \textsc{idef} stone-\textsc{ob} on take.away.\textsc{cv}   \textsc{def.msg.nom} child seat.\textsc{pfv"=msg} seat.\textsc{cv} \textsc{3sg.gn} clothes take.off-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `(In that forest he took the child to a~stone and seated him.) \textit{When he had seated him,} he took his (the child's) clothes off.' (A:BER005)

\ex
\label{ex:13-52}
\gll (tíi taayúu hiǰrát thíil-i.) [hiǰrát the] dhruú$\sim$ṣ-a yúul-u \\
\textsc{3sg.ob} from.there migration do.\textsc{pfv-f}    migration do-\textsc{cv} Drosh-\textsc{ob} come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `(He migrated from there.) \textit{When he had migrated}, he came to Drosh.' (B:ATI003-4) 
\end{exe}

As was the case in clause chaining, the corresponding construction when the subject in the dependent
clause is different from the subject in the main clause is a~finite \textit{ta}-clause
(construction~(ii)), as can be seen in example (\ref{ex:13-53}) and (\ref{ex:2-8})\authcomm{Is the
  reference to example \ref{ex:2-8} correct? Or did you mean to refer to example \ref{ex:13-54}
  here?}. Again, the verb in the preceding finite clause is often found repeated.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-53}
\gll (aḍaphará wháil-u.) [aḍaphara wháil-u ta] tasíi uǰut-í maǰí xaaráx paidóo bhíl-i \\
halfways take.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg} halfways  take.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg } \textsc{prt} \textsc{3sg.gn} body-\textsc{ob} in itching born become.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `(He brought him down halfways.) \textit{When he had brought him down halfways}, his body started to itch.' (A:DRA020)

\ex
\label{ex:13-54}
\gll [raaǰaá múṛ-u ta] putr-óom tasíi hukumát bulooṣṭéel-i \\
king die.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} son-\textsc{pl.ob} \textsc{3sg.gn}  government snatch.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `When the king died, the sons seized the power.' (A:MAB003)
\end{exe}

It appears to be possible to leave out the particle \textit{ta}, as in (\ref{ex:13-55}), and retain a~different"=subject reading, although that is not particularly common.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-55}
\gll [naɡarǰúti yhéel-i] tas díi khooǰóol-u kanaá bhíl-i \\
Nagarjuti come.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{3sg.acc} from ask.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  what become.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `When Nagarjuti came, he asked her what happened.' (MAB029) 
\end{exe}

While the subsequential reading is contextually implicit rather than explicit in the examples given so far, a~separate temporal conjunction \textit{kareeɡalé} or \textit{kareé ɡalé ki} `when' can also (possibly more readily so in B.), as seen in (\ref{ex:13-56}), be added to the \textit{ta}-construction to make this reading obvious, and also distinguish it more clearly from simple clause chaining.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-56}
\gll [kareeɡalé se múṛ-im ta] asím tenaám ḍhanɡéel"=im \\
when \textsc{3pl.nom} die.\textsc{pfv"=fpl} \textsc{prt} \textsc{1pl.erg} \textsc{3pl.acc} bury.\textsc{pfv"=fpl} \\
\glt `When they died, we buried them.' (B:FOR037) 
\end{exe}

This construction has characteristics of a~relative clause (cf. \sectref{subsec:13-6-2}), like a~number of similar temporal adverbial constructions in the world's languages \citep[180--181]{thompsonlongacre1985}, which is even more obvious in (\ref{ex:13-57}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-57}
\gll [hasó kareé ɡalé ki sastíil-u ta] ṣúu itlaá phedíl-i \\
\textsc{3msg.nom} when ever \textsc{prt} heal.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} king message arrive.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `When he had become healthy, a~message arrived from the king.' (B:ATI059) 
\end{exe}

A finite temporal clause with \textit{kareé} and without \textit{ta} (\ref{ex:13-58}) is also possible.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-58}
\gll [kareé ǰéel-i] c̣hiír taap-áan-a \\
when give.birth.\textsc{pfv-f} milk heat.up-\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `When it [goat] has given birth, we heat up the milk.' (A:KEE025) 
\end{exe}

Perfective Participle clauses with a~postposition, such as \textit{pahúrta, baád}, \textit{patú,} all glossed as `after', are also used in temporal subsequence (construction~(iv)). \textit{pahúrta} (in (\ref{ex:13-59})) and \textit{baád} (in (\ref{ex:13-60})) each governs the genitive case of the participle, whereas \textit{patú} (in (\ref{ex:13-61})) takes the nominative. The latter seems to occur only in B. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-59}
\gll [iẓḍúur-a ǰe ɡúum"=ii pahúrta] tas yhéel-i audás \\
Ijdur-\textsc{ob} up.to go.\textsc{pptc.msg"=gn} after \textsc{3sg.acc} come.\textsc{pfv-f} urge \\
\glt `When he had gone up to Ijdur, he felt a~need to urinate.' (A:AYA)

\ex
\label{ex:13-60}
\gll [ṣaawóol"=ii báad] dúi bhíiru mheeríl-u \\
put.on.\textsc{pptc.msg"=gn} after another he.goat kill.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `When he had put it on, he killed another he"=goat.' (A:DRA024)

\ex
\label{ex:13-61}
\gll [ɡhíin-u patú] ǰumeet-í the bay-áan-u  \\
take.\textsc{pptc.msg} after mosque-\textsc{ob} to go-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `\textit{When I have taken it (a bath),} I go to the mosque.' (B:MOR004) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Subsequence cum instrument.} The temporal subsequence reading of the Converb construction shades off into what can be seen as expressing instrument or supplying the main verb with a~manner specification and is especially relevant for Converbs formed from transitive verbs of motion, as in examples (\ref{ex:13-62})--(\ref{ex:13-65}), such as \textit{ɡhín-} `take', \textit{de-} `put, give', \textit{ɡaḍé-} `take out', \textit{ɡhašé-} `take hold of, grab', \textit{ɡalé-} `throw'. With some of these Converbs we may very well witness a~further grammaticalisation into postpositions, alternatively, the development of compound verbs (see \sectref{subsec:8-6-2}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-62}
\gll ɡhaḍeerá phed-í laṣ-čax [kaṭéeri ɡhin-í] se taáǰ čhiníl-i. čhin-í [rumeel-í maǰí de] ǰeep-í-ee dít-i \\

\glt `The elder (brother) came, took a~knife, and cut off the crown. Having cut it off, he wrapped it in a~handkerchief and then put it into his pocket' (A:DRA016)

\ex

\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Accompanying circumstance.} The Converb construction can also express an~accompanying circumstance, or a~means specification with reference to the same subject and the same event. In (\ref{ex:13-66})--(\ref{ex:13-68}) a~subsequential interpretation is even less an~issue.

\end{exe}

However, an~accompanying circumstance, or further specification of the action carried out by the subject, is sometimes, as in (\ref{ex:13-69}) and (\ref{ex:13-70}), expressed with the more restricted Copredicative Participle (construction~(vii)).

\glt `The boy kept looking back and disappeared behind a~ridge still waving his hand.' (A:SHY035) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Simultaneity.} Simultaneity involves two overlapping events and includes what
\citet[330]{givon2001b} refers to as ``point coincidence''. The backgrounded event
\citep[188--189]{thompsonlongacre1985} is usually expressed with a~Verbal Noun (construction~(v)) in
Palula. If the subject is the same in the foregrounded as well as in the backgrounded event, the
Verbal Noun occurs alone, as in (\ref{ex:13-71}), or with a~postposition \textit{maǰí} `in,
among' (\ref{ex:13-72}) or \textit{sanɡí} `with', whereas if there is a~subject shift between
the foregrounded and the backgrounded event, the Verbal Noun (or the postposition) occurs, as in
(\ref{ex:13-73}) and (\ref{ex:13-74}), with a~suffix \textsc{-eé} (probably
accent"=bearing and not necessarily identical with the accent"=neutral coordinating suffix presented
in \sectref{subsec:13-2-1}), which functions as a~switch"=reference marker similar to the contrast between
\textit{ta}-constructions vis-à-vis Converb constructions described above.

\glt `Just as the dragon went into the sack, the fox signaled to the man to pull the string.' (B:DRB)
\end{exe}

A somewhat parallel strategy is the use of an~Agentive Verbal Noun and \textit{bhe-} `become', (\ref{ex:13-75})--(\ref{ex:13-76}), lit. `became an~onlooker, became goers', etc. (construction~(vi)). With these constructions, it is not always obvious which event is backgrounded and which one is foregrounded. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-75}

\glt `One day, as they were walking through a~forest, suddenly a~lion appeared.' (A:UNF005-6) 
\end{exe}

Less commonly, simultaneity or temporal overlap is expressed with a~Perfective verb form with a~suffixed \textit{ee}-conjunction, as in (\ref{ex:13-77}). Whether the Perfective verb form is finite or nonfinite in this case, I do not have a~conclusive answer to at the moment.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-77}
\gll [so ta ɡúum"=ee] ma ba patuɡiraá yhóol-u \\
\textsc{3sg.nom} \textsc{prt} go.\textsc{pfv"=cnj} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{prt} back  come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `As he left, I went back (home).' (A:HUA043) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Precedence.} In the temporal clauses mentioned so far, there is either an~implied simultaneity or a~sequence of events where the subordinate (or cosubordinate) `when'-clause refers to an~event taking place before the event named in the main clause. In so"=called precedence clauses \citep[327]{givon2001b}, on the other hand, the event in the `before'-clause has not yet been realised in relation to the event mentioned in the main clause \citep[182]{thompsonlongacre1985}. For such clauses a~Verbal Noun with the complex postposition \textit{díi muṣṭú} `before' (in B. \textit{díi muxáak}) is used, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-78})--(\ref{ex:13-80}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-78}
\gll ṭhaaṭáak-a ba [bheš-ainií díi muṣṭú] tas díi nóo khooǰóol-u maní \\

\label{ex:13-79}
\gll [khinǰ-ainií díi muṣṭú] thíi su"=eeṇḍéew  \\

\glt `It is necessary to think properly before a~work is carried out.' (B:FOX)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{subsec:13-4-2}

Dependent clauses expressing the purpose for an~event to be carried out usually have an~implicit human subject coreferential with the (normally) explicit subject of the main clause \citep[337]{givon2001b}. The construction used, a~Verbal Noun followed by the postposition `to', parallels such ``dative'' purpose clauses found in many other languages \citep[186--187]{thompsonlongacre1985}. The finite verb in sentences, such as (\ref{ex:13-81})--(\ref{ex:13-82}), is almost invariably an~intransitive motion verb `come', `go', etc.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-81}
\gll nu ba [asaám mhaar"=ainií the] ukháat-u de thaní \\
\textsc{3msg.prox.nom} \textsc{prt} \textsc{1pl.acc} kill-\textsc{vn} to come.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{pst} \textsc{qt}  \\
\glt `He has come down to kill us.' (A:HUA071)

\ex
\label{ex:13-82}
\gll phoo-íi ɡhooṣṭ-íi tarapíi tasíi axpul-aán kuṛíina míiš-a [teeṇíi se bhoói paš-ainií the] biáan-a \\
boy-\textsc{gn} house-\textsc{gn} direction \textsc{3sg.gn} relative-\textsc{pl} woman.\textsc{pl}  man-\textsc{pl} \textsc{refl} \textsc{def} daughter"=in"=law see-\textsc{vn} to go.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `The relatives, men and women from the boy's house, are going (there), to see their daughter"=in law.' (A:MAR104) 
\end{exe}

Not infrequently the verb itself is implicit in the purpose clause, and instead the direct object argument, `bowls' in (\ref{ex:13-83}), receives the ``dative'' marking.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-83}
\gll theé ba se iṇc̣ kaṭamuš-á the óol thawaá [looṛíi-am the] ɡíia hín-a \\
do.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{3pl.nom} bear Katamosh-\textsc{ob} to watch  make.do.\textsc{cv} bowl-\textsc{pl.ob} to go.\textsc{pfv.mpl} be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `Then they made the bear watch Katamosh and went to get bowls [lit. for bowls].' (A:KAT127) 
\end{exe}

Purpose is also quite often explicitly expressed by the postposition \textit{dapáara} `for, for the sake of' (a Pashto loan) following the Verbal Noun, as in (\ref{ex:13-84}) or (in B.), the postposition \textit{pándee} `for, for the sake of' following the Verbal Noun in the genitive, as in (\ref{ex:13-85}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-84}
\gll [bhraawéeli th"=ainií dapáara] tanaám maǰí áak qabúl th-áan-u ki ma bhíiru ɡhin-í thíi ɡhooṣṭ-á the yh-úum \\

\glt `In order to form a~brotherhood, one of them agrees to bring a~he"=goat to the other one's house.' (A:MIT013)

\ex
\label{ex:13-85}
\gll ɡhooṣṭ-á baás de ba patuɡiraák [tenaám dac̣h-aníi-e pándee] ɡhireé ɡáu \\
house-\textsc{ob}  shelter give-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} back \textsc{3pl.acc}  look-\textsc{vn"=gn} for again go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \\
\glt `After spending the night at home, he went back again to look at them.' (B:BEL335)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Causality}
\label{subsec:13-4-3}

As noted by \citet[181]{thompsonlongacre1985}, it is no surprise that we find causal relationships expressed in the same way as temporal relationships, or rather that the constructions themselves are neutral between a~time and a~cause interpretation. Often in Palula, dependent clauses, such as the different"=subject \textit{ta}-construction (see \sectref{subsec:13-4-1}), can thus imply an~immediately preceding event in time as well as a~cause for the event or action in the main clause to happen or be carried out. 



Example (\ref{ex:13-50}), quoted above, may, for instance, be given a~sequential interpretation as well as a~causal one: `When a~daughter of yours was born, your wife took her and went up into the forest' (sequential), or: `Because a~daughter of yours was born, your wife took her and went up into the forest' (causal).



As further pointed out by \citet[335]{givon2001b}, cause (along with reason) can itself be divided into a~number of subdistinctions, such as agentive external, non"=agentive external, eventive external, non"=eventive external, eventive internal and non"=eventive internal.



For external causality, the preferred strategy is, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-86}), the already mentioned finite different"=subject construction with \textit{ta}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-86}
\gll [ǰaanɡul-á ma bhanǰóol-u ta] ru-áan-u  \\
Jangul-\textsc{ob} \textsc{1sg.nom} beat.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} cry-\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `Jangul beat me, therefore I'm weeping.' (A:HUA104)
\end{exe}

A construction involving a~Verbal Noun,\footnote{To what degree any of the case suffixes in the examples from Biori correspond to the (possibly conjunctive) suffix \textit{-ee} in the Ashret example remains at this point an~unanswered question.} also used to imply simultaneity (see above), can also be used to signal causality, as in (\ref{ex:13-87})--(\ref{ex:13-89}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-87}
\gll [panaahí dawainíi-a] ɣeyratxaan-á ba tes teeṇíi ɡhúuṛu téste de ba tes har-í har-í raulée phará the ba nawaab-í ḍáḍi lanɡúul-u \\

\glt `Asking him for shelter, Ghairat Khan gave him his own horse and took him across Lowari to the territory of the prince (of Dir).' (B:ATI026-7)

\ex
\label{ex:13-88}

\glt `The bear was wounded from the firing.' (B:BEL320)

\ex
\label{ex:13-89}
\gll [so ma pharé ḍhak"=ainíi-ee] piaalá ma díi lháast-u \\

\glt `He bumped me, so I dropped the cup.' (A:CHE071107) 
\end{exe}

For most cases of internal causality, where the same"=subject condition holds, the Converb construction is used, as in (\ref{ex:13-90}) and (\ref{ex:13-91}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-90}
\gll [ma boór bhe] táayii ɡúum  \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} bored become.\textsc{cv} from.there go.\textsc{pfv.msg}  \\
\glt `I was bored, so I left.' (A:CHE071107)

\ex
\label{ex:13-91}
\gll [se xálaka qalánɡ na d-áa bhaá ba] uḍheew-í ɡíia \\
 \textsc{def} people tax \textsc{neg} give-\textsc{inf} be.able.to.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt}  flee-\textsc{cv}  go.\textsc{pfv.mpl}   \\
\glt `The people were not able to pay the taxes, so they left, fleeing.' (A:MAB030) 
\end{exe}

Causality (perhaps internal in particular) can also be expressed in a~more explicit way, for instance, as in (\ref{ex:13-92}), through a~relativisation of \textit{waǰa} `reason', a~noun borrowed from Pashto, or a~dependent clause with a~Verbal Noun and a~postposition, the latter exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-93}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-92}
\gll [so wáǰa ba eeṛó ki so lhookéer-u brhoó so kaná pharé ɡal-í

\glt `Because (lit. for the reason that) he had carried his younger brother on his shoulder, he was affected.' (A:DRA028-9)

\glt `Since the goat didn't really think, she fell prey to the wolf.' (B:FOX)
\end{exe}

\footnotetext{I do not have any explanation for this form to appear. If it indeed is a~determiner of the oblique case"=marked \textit{kaná}, the form \textit{se} is expected.}

\subsection{Conditionality}
\label{subsec:13-4-4}

As is the case in many languages \citep[193]{thompsonlongacre1985}, there is in Palula no absolute distinction made between temporality and conditionality. Although there are distinct morphological markings available to signal conditionality, there is, as we shall see, some overlap in coding between clauses with an~implied temporality (and to some extent causality) vis-à-vis clauses with conditional semantics.



It is also, as noted by \citet[190--191]{thompsonlongacre1985}, as well as by \citet[333--334]{givon2001b}, possible for languages to make explicit finer gradations along a~scale of verisimilitude, an~observation relevant for the analysis of Palula conditionals. We can discern at least three degrees of verisimilitude: a) generally true, b) possibly or probably true, and c) not true. These will be discussed and exemplified under the following headings: assumed conditionality, hypothetical conditionality, and counterfactuality.



\spitzmarke{Assumed conditionality.} Conditionals under this heading partly match what \citet[190--191]{thompsonlongacre1985} refers to as reality conditionals. Here we find the conditionally marked clauses that are closest related to temporality and causality as described above. Often the conditionally marked clause is equally translatable with `when{\ldots}' and `if{\ldots}' (and especially with past"=time reference, `whenever'). The typical construction is a~finite (often Perfective) `if'-clause with the conditionality marker \textit{sée$\sim$ta (B. síinta)}, followed by an~imperfective `then'-clause. They describe a~condition that usually holds, especially in a~more generic sense, or used to do so in the past. Examples are given in (\ref{ex:13-94})--(\ref{ex:13-97}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-94}
\gll [misrí yhóol-u sée$\sim$ta] misrí díi tsaṭák hóons-a \\
mason come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condh} mason from hammer stay-\textsc{3sg}  \\
\glt `When the mason comes, he (usually) has a~hammer with him.' (A:HOW010)

\ex
\label{ex:13-95}
\gll [bíiḍ-u táru bi dít-u sée$\sim$ta] xaráab  bh-éen-i \\
much-\textsc{msg} quickly also give.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condh} bad  become-\textsc{prs-f}   \\
\glt `But also if it [salt] is given too often, it will harm her [the goat].' (A:KEE019)

\ex
\label{ex:13-96}
\gll [paačhambeé uthíit-u sée$\sim$ta] so bi  uth-íi de maní \\
Pashambi stand.up.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condh} \textsc{3sg.nom} also stand.up-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \textsc{hsay}  \\
\glt `If/Whenever Pashambi stood up, he [the monster] would also stand up.' (A:UXB016)

\ex
\label{ex:13-97}
\gll [ac̣húuṛi-m ṭhak"=ainií waxt bhíl-u sée$\sim$ta]  yh-íin de \\

\glt `Whenever it was the time of walnut shedding, they used to come.' (A:JAN015) 
\end{exe}

Sometimes the clause"=final conditional marker also co"=occurs, as in (\ref{ex:13-98}), with a~temporal conjunction \textit{kareé} `when'. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-98}
\gll [míiš-ii putr kareé zuwaán bhíl-u sée$\sim$ta]  tas the kúṛi dawainií

\glt `When/If someone's son becomes of age, he then arranges for his marriage.' (A:MAR003-4) 
\end{exe}

Some clauses with a~predictive semantics are coded in the same manner, either with the `if'-clause in the Perfective (\ref{ex:13-99}) or in the Future (\ref{ex:13-100}), although most predictions tend to be coded as hypothetical conditionals (see below). Again, the choice between the two is most likely to do with the degree of predictability, although in some predictive contexts the two codings are used more or less interchangeably.

\begin{exe}

\glt `If/When I come, whatever time during the night, and knock, you should come out, and we will go to work.' (A:WOM628) 
\end{exe}

In some clauses, such as in (\ref{ex:13-101}), \textit{síinta} clearly implies cause rather than condition, particularly in B. it seems.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-101}
\gll [koó se muṭ-á túuri-e thíi baṭ-áam  ǰ-áan-a šíinta ba] kúuk-a

\glt `Because someone is throwing stones from under the tree, the crows cannot sit down.' (B:SHB741) 
\end{exe}

In some pieces of discourse, \textit{sée$\sim$ta/síinta} is also used clause"=initially, as a~single element, either without any obvious reference to any preceding clause and with a~rather vague semantics, glossed as `then' or `well', or with a~very general causal reference to a~larger chunk of discourse, functioning as a~conjunction with the meaning `so', `therefore' or `it means'. An example of the latter is (\ref{ex:13-102}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-102}
\gll sée$\sim$ta asíi iskuúl bi asaám the bíiḍ-i dhúura  hín-i \\

\glt `So (as I said), we also have a~long way to school.' (A:OUR016) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Hypothetical conditionality.} These conditionals belong mainly under the imaginary type, following \citeauthor{thompsonlongacre1985}'s (\citeyear[195]{thompsonlongacre1985}) classification. Examples (\ref{ex:13-103})--(\ref{ex:13-104}) express conditions of a~lower verisimilitude than the assumed conditionals above. The conditionally"=marked clause of this kind, often translatable with `if{\ldots}', is a~finite (often Perfective) clause with the conditionality marker \textit{hée$\sim$ta}, followed by an~imperfective `then'-clause. They describe a~condition that is probable or possible, although to a~certain extent imagined. Most conditionals referring to the future are also coded this way.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-103}

\glt `If two persons like one another, they become brothers, they form a~brotherhood.' (A:MIT010-1) 
\end{exe}

The same structure is found in negative conditionals (\ref{ex:13-105}) as well.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-105}

\glt `If you don't take these (to her), I will ask you on the day of judgement.' (B:FLW800) 
\end{exe}

As with assumed conditionality, the clause"=final conditional marker also co"=occurs with a~temporal conjunction in some instances of hypothetical conditionality, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-106}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-106}
\gll [maṇḍáu kareé thíil-u hée$\sim$ta] maṇḍáu wée  ɡhareé ḍhínɡar ɡhooṣṭ-á díi tuúš muxtalíf bh-áan-u  \\

\glt `Whenever/if you were to make a~veranda, the wood of the veranda would be different from that of the house.' (A:HOW073) 
\end{exe}

Besides the `then'-clauses in (\ref{ex:13-103})--(\ref{ex:13-106}) with Future and Present verb forms, the Imperative as well as the Perfective are possible verb forms to use in future"=referring `then'-clauses, both occurring in (\ref{ex:13-107}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-107}

\glt `Were he to die, then bury him, were he, however, to stay alive, then we have given him to you.' (B:ATI052) 
\end{exe}

Quite infrequently, the `if'-clause occurs in a~TMA category other than the Perfective. The utterance in (\ref{ex:13-108}) is in effect a~threat, while the utterance in (\ref{ex:13-109}) is a~polite request.

\begin{exe}

\end{exe}

\footnotetext{This is not the expected form of a~determiner, since the head is a~masculine singular nominative.}


Apart from the explicitly marked condional clauses examplified above, we also find conditionality implied in Converb clauses, as in (\ref{ex:13-110}), as well as in \textit{ta}-clauses, as in (\ref{ex:13-111}). The Past Imperfective in the `then'-clause in (\ref{ex:13-111}) implies unfulfilment by itself.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-110}

\glt `If I were to tell my companions, they would leave the corpse and run away.' (A:GHA047) 
\end{exe}

Also the coordinate adversative construction \textit{ta{\ldots}ba} (see \sectref{subsec:13-2-1}), as in (\ref{ex:13-112}), can by itself imply conditionality.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-112}
\gll [ma nis áaǰ kh-úum ta rhootašíi-a  ba kanáa bh-úum \\

\glt `If I eat this today, what will then become of me tomorrow?' (A:HUB005) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Counterfactuality.} In counterfactual expressions, as in (\ref{ex:13-113})--(\ref{ex:13-114}), both the `if'-clause and the `then'-clause occur with the conditionality marker of low verisimilitude, \textit{hée$\sim$ta}, i.e. the one also used in the hypothetical expressions above. The word \textit{áɡar} in (\ref{ex:13-114}) is a~subordinating expression also occurring in Urdu conditionality \citep[101--103]{schmidt1999}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-113}
\gll [yáraa ma islaamabaad-á ɡáu de  hée$\sim$ta] šúi bhíl-u de hée$\sim$ta,

\glt `Oh, if I had gone to Islamabad, it would have been good, I would have seen Islamabad.' (B:ISH001-2)

\ex
\label{ex:13-114}
\gll \label{bkm:Ref190830564}[áɡar thíi dóodu ǰáand-u heensíl-u  hée$\sim$ta]

\glt `If your grandfather were still alive, he would by now be 80 years old.' (A:HLE3086) 
\end{exe}

The proposition in the `if'-clause of (\ref{ex:13-114}) is contrary to fact, i.e. the person speaking knows for sure that the person referred to is dead, and therefore the `then'-clause here expresses what would have been the case if that had been otherwise, whereas if the verisimilitude value is pending \citep[332]{givon2001b}, as is the case with the hypothetical conditionality exemplified already, the proposition of the `then'-clause may still be true. A hypothetical conditionality contrasting with the counterfactuality in (\ref{ex:13-114}) can be seen in the almost parallel sentence in (\ref{ex:13-115}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-115}

\glt `If his grandfather is still alive, he would be 80 years old.' (A:HLE3086) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Concessive conditionality.} Concessive conditionality is basically expressed by the same means as hypothetical conditionality, i.e. with a~finite (often Perfective) `if'-clause with the conditionality"=marker \textit{hée$\sim$ta}. However, as seen in (\ref{ex:13-116}) and (\ref{ex:13-117}), the particle \textit{bi} `also, even' is added to emphasise the contrary"=to"=expectation reading. 

\begin{exe}

\glt `Even if he were offering me the double salary, I would not take the job.' (A:CHE071114)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Clauses with other adverbial functions}
\label{subsec:13-4-5}

\spitzmarke{Concessive clauses.} There is probably no unique strategy for forming concessive clauses. A conjunction with ``adversative'' reading (see \sectref{subsec:13-2-1}--\sectref{subsec:13-2-2}) can, for instance, be used for this purpose, with (\ref{ex:13-118}) or without (\ref{ex:13-119}) the contrary"=to"=expectation particle \textit{bi} `also, even'. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-118}
\gll [so šúi paaṇṭí bi ṣaá  heensíl-u de] xu bač na bhíl-u  \\
\textsc{3sg.nom} good.\textsc{f} clothes even put.on.\textsc{cv}  stay.\textsc{pfv"=msg } \textsc{pst} but saved \textsc{neg} become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Even though he was wearing good clothes, he did not survive.' (A:CHE071114)

\ex
\label{ex:13-119}
\gll [míi parčá ta dít-u xu ma paás  ba na bh"=eeṇḍeéu \\
\textsc{1sg.gn} paper \textsc{prt} give.\textsc{pfv"=msg} but \textsc{1sg.nom} passed \textsc{prt} \textsc{neg} become-\textsc{oblg} \\
\glt `Although I turned in my paper, I will not pass.' (A:CHE071114) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Substitutive clauses.} As with concessive clauses there is no single dedicated substitutive construction. Instead a~few different constructions are used to express the semantics of a~substitutive.


First, there are constructions involving the noun \textit{zhaái} `place'. The one exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-120}), has a~subordinate clause almost analogous to the English `instead of{\ldots}', with a~Verbal Noun qualifying the oblique form of \textit{zhaái}. The `place'-noun in (\ref{ex:13-121}) is on the other hand only qualified by a~possessive clause and is therefore not a~subordinate clause at all. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-120}
\gll [karaačí the bainií zhay-í] ma ba laahur-á  the ɡúum \\
Karachi to go.\textsc{vn} place-\textsc{ob} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{prt} Lahore-\textsc{ob} to go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \\
\glt `Instead of going to Karachi, I went to Lahore.' (A:CHE071114)

\ex
\label{ex:13-121}
\gll ibrahiím aleehisalaam-íi putr ismaaíil-e zhay-í  míi dúudu qurbaán bhe hín-u \\
Ibrahim peace"=be"=upon"=him-\textsc{gn} son Ismail-\textsc{ gn} place-\textsc{ob}  \textsc{1sg.gn} forefather sacrifice become.\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `My forefather was sacrificed instead [lit. in the place] of Ibrahim's (PBUH) son Ismail.' (B:SHI013) 
\end{exe}

It is also possible to use a~comparative construction `X-ing a, is better than X-ing b'. In this case, as seen in (\ref{ex:13-122}), the subject head as well as the head of the predicate noun phrase are Verbal Nouns.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-122}
\gll [pulusá the man"=ainií díi] máa-the man"=ainií šóo de \\
police to say-\textsc{vn} from \textsc{1sg.nom-}to say-\textsc{vn} good.\textsc{msg} be.\textsc{pst} \\
\glt `Rather than telling the police, you should have told me [Lit. The telling to me is better than the telling to the police].' (A:CHE071114) 
\end{exe}

Although implicit to a~larger extent, a~substitutive reading of an~utterance"=complement with the direct"=quote marker \textit{thaní} (cf. \sectref{subsec:13-5-1}), is also possible ((\ref{ex:13-123})--(\ref{ex:13-124})) and may very well be the preferred way of expressing substitution. In (\ref{ex:13-124}) this interpretation is supported by the word \textit{ulṭá} `upside"=down'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-123}
\gll [ma karaačí the béem thaní] laahur-á the  ɡúum \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} Karachi to go.\textsc{1sg} \textsc{qt} Lahore-\textsc{ob} to go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \\
\glt `Instead of going to Karachi [as I said], I went to Lahore.' (A:CHE071114)

\ex
\label{ex:13-124}
\gll [díiš-a ba baalbač-á kuṛíina tamá  th-éen de asée bharíiw-a be

\glt `In the village the children and women were waiting, but instead of the husbands coming back from the hunting with game and meat, those three corpses were brought down by people on that day.' (B:AVA218-20) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Additive clauses.} There is not much evidence of any entirely unique construction expressing additive semantics. Instead the conjunction with \textit{bi{\ldots}bi} (see \sectref{subsec:13-2-1}) seems to cover some occurrences of ``addition''. Possibly the construction found in (\ref{ex:13-125}), with a~subordinate Verbal Noun followed by the postposition \textit{sanɡí} `with' along with \textit{bi} in the main clause, represents a~more explicit expression of ``addition''. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-125}
\gll [ma bhanǰ-ainíi-a sanɡí] áak the tíi míi  paiseé bi palóol-a \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} beat-\textsc{vn"=ob} with one to \textsc{3sg.ob} \textsc{1sg.gn} money.\textsc{pl}  also steal.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `Besides beating me up, he stole my money.' (A:CHE071114) 
\end{exe}

It is uncertain what role the adverbial phrase \textit{áak the} plays in signalling ``addition''. It also occurs in (\ref{ex:13-126}), where a~similar reading is possible, although the two clauses here are symmetric rather than one of them being subordinate the other.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-126}
\gll haṛó hateeṇ-ú deés de ki [ak  the kir bíiḍ-u de] [dhuíime xálak  adrax-í heensíl-a] \\
\textsc{3msg.rem.nom} such-\textsc{msg}  day be.\textsc{pst} \textsc{comp} one  to snow much-\textsc{msg} be.\textsc{pst} second people  forest"=ob stay.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `It was such a~day, that besides there being a~lot of snow, people were in the forest (or It was such a~day, that on the one hand there was a~lot of snow, and on the other there were people in the forest).' (B:AVA216)
\end{exe}

\section{Complement clauses}
\label{sec:13-5}

Palula utilises a~number of different strategies for sentential complementation, mainly determined by the complement"=taking verb. However, due to the degree of semantic bond between the complement"=taking predicate and the verbal element of the complement \citep[39-40]{givon2001b}, most of them fall, quite clearly, into one of two main types: a) sentence"=like complements, and b) nonfinite complements. While the complements of the first type usually (but not exclusively) are extraposed and syntactically are relatively independent from the main clause, the complements of the second type are almost invariably embedded into the main clause and have a~time reference entirely determined by the main clause.

The specific strategies found in the S-like main type are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] A zero strategy, or juxtaposition, whereby the complement, always a~direct"=quote utterance, occurs after the main clause and its complement"=taking predicate without any overt complementiser or other linking device
\item[(ii)] A very broadly applied \textit{ki}-strategy, whereby a~particle or complementiser \textit{ki} follows the complement"=taking predicate and precedes the extraposed (heavy"=shifted) finite complement clause (basically an~instance of relativisation, see \sectref{subsec:13-6-7})
\item[(iii)] A \textit{thané}-strategy, whereby a~reported discourse complement precedes a~form of \textit{thané-} `say' (often in the Converb form \textit{thaní})
\item[(iv)] A minor \textit{ta}-strategy, whereby a~particle \textit{ta} follows the complement"=taking predicate and precedes the extraposed finite complement clause (basically an~instance of clause chaining, see \sectref{sec:13-3})
\end{enumerate}

An importance feature of the S-like complements with the strategies (i)--(iii) is that they always take a~quoted"=speaker's/quoted"=experiencer's perspective as far as pronominal reference and deixis are concerned. This also means that there are hardly any constructions that are indirect; probably no reported speech ever occurs as indirect.


Strategy (ii) used with reported discourse is often combined with strategy (iii), in which case \textit{thané-} mainly functions as a (end"=of) quotation marker (see discussion in \sectref{subsec:9-2-4}).


The specific strategies found in the nonfinite type are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(v)] A complement in the form of a~Verbal Noun embedded into the main clause, a~broadly applied strategy
\item[(vi)] A complement in the form of an~Infinitive, showing a~high degree of integration between the complement and the main clause
\item[(vii)] A causative construction in which the complement"=taking predicate is entirely co"=lexicalised with the complement
\end{enumerate}
Strategy~(vii) represents the top of the complementation scale \citep[74]{givon2001b} and is at best only underlyingly analysable as two clauses, but is included here as there is no other natural context for it to be discussed.


A few additional minor strategies are examplified below, but due to their isolated occurrence in the data, they have not been listed above.



In the following we will exemplify and discuss these strategies as they occur within some broadly and functionally defined classes or categories of complement"=taking predicates (following \citealt[40--59]{givon2001b} and \citealt[110-33]{noonan1985}). However, as will be apparent in the discussion, the strategies outlined above are not randomly applied, but represent a~language"=internal differentiation along a~continuum. This is a~continuum that, on the one hand, stretches from complement"=taking PCU (Perception"=Cognition"=Utterance) predicates with a~weak bond between the two events to modality predicates with a~strong bond between them. On the other hand, it is a~continuum stretching between PCU predicates with a~weak bond to manipulation predicates with a~strong bond between the two events.


\subsection{Complement"=taking PCU predicates}
\label{subsec:13-5-1}

\spitzmarke{Utterance predicates.} Only with utterance predicates is the zero strategy ((i), above) alone used, and even then sparingly. According to my data, it is only the verb \textit{mané-} `say, call, tell', as in (\ref{ex:13-127})--(\ref{ex:13-128}), that seems to allow it.

\begin{exe}

\glt `A woman told him: ``A daughter was born, and your wife took her with her and went up into the forest.''' (B:FOR013-4) 
\end{exe}

More frequently, the \textit{ki}-strategy ((ii) above) is used, with \textit{mané-} as well as with a~number of other utterance predicates (or predicates that in the context imply an~utterance): (\ref{ex:13-129})--(\ref{ex:13-131}). Always when \textit{ki} is used as a~complementiser, the complement is heavy"=shifted to the end.

\begin{exe}

\glt `The fox shouted: ``Oh lion, oh leopard, oh bear, come quickly, I've found the bald one.''' (A:KAT118-9) 
\end{exe}

Related utterances in Palula always occur as direct quotations, as can be seen in the examples (\ref{ex:13-127})--(\ref{ex:13-131}), or more correctly, they are always presented from a~quoted"=speaker's or experiencer's (i.e. the subject of the matrix clause) perspective, as far as deixis, pronominal and time reference is concerned. Non"=verbal ``utterances''\footnote{It is probably equally possible to classify the predicate in a~sentence like this as desiderative~-- i.e. expressing a~desire that the proposition be realised~-- rather than as an~uttererance predicate.} are treated in this way too, i.e. thoughts, as in (\ref{ex:13-132}), are presented from the thinking agent's perspective, as if they were uttered verbally (a marginal exception to this is found with what I refer to below as ``immediate perception predicates''). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-132}
\gll áa deés se phoó xiaál thíil-i híni ki  [tuúš čhoót míi
  se yaar-íi rumeel-í  maǰí ɡhaṇḍ-í wíi-a keé-na ɡal-úum] \\

\glt `One day the boy thought: ``Why don't I put some cheese in my friend's handkerchief and throw it in the water.''' (A:SHY043)
\end{exe}

While the complement of the utterance predicates mentioned so far are all extraposed (vis-à-vis the basic SOV word order) and have to be so when used this way, that is never allowed with any form of the verb \textit{thané-} `say, call' (strategy~(iii) above), as in (\ref{ex:13-133})--(\ref{ex:13-134}). Note that, in example (\ref{ex:13-134}), the sentence with \textit{thaní} is part of a~longer clause chain (see \sectref{sec:13-3}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-133}

\glt `The Chitrali people became very happy, saying ``He has saved our reputation [lit. made our name live]'', and they also gave awards and distributed sweets' (A:BEW007-9) 
\end{exe}

The verb \textit{thané-} refers straightforwardly and literally back to what was actually uttered,
and especially when combined with another utterance predicate and/or \textit{ki} preceding the
utterance, which is the case in (\ref{ex:13-135}) and (\ref{ex:13-136}), it becomes by effect
an~end"=of"=quotation marker, particularly in its Converb shape \textit{thaní}.\footnote{That
  \textit{thaní} is becoming grammaticalised to a~large extent is reflected in its being used rather
  often, contrary to expectation even when there is a~subject switch, while a~converb normally
  signals same"=subject reference across clauses (as described elsewhere) without having any clear
  connection with the following discourse.}

\begin{exe}

\glt `I called out: ``Oh uncle, uncle, the bear has eaten the goat'', whereby Pashambi slowly put down his load.' (A:PAS056-7) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Propositional attitude predicates.} Closely related to and sometimes difficult to distinguish from utterance predicates are those predicates that express an~attitude regarding the complement proposition, especially concerning its verisimilitude value. The particle \textit{xu} (in examples (\ref{ex:13-137}) and (\ref{ex:13-138})) expresses certainty on the part of the subject of the matrix clause concerning the immediately preceding argument or phrase.


It seems also that the range of strategies available is much the same as for utterance predicates. The complement is, like the former, presented in direct (reported) discourse, often signalled by the end"=of"=quotation marker \textit{thaní}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-137}
\gll se míiš-a soóč thíil-i ki [anú xu  típa ma páta kh-óo] (thaní ba) \\

\glt `The man thought that he would surely eat him too [lit. The man thought: ``He will now eat me also'']. (Having said that{\ldots})' (A:THA009-10)

\ex
\label{ex:13-138}

\glt `I thought: ``Oh my God! These must be the foot prints of a~camel. Well, in any case I'll go ahead and follow them.''' (A:HUA061-2) 
\end{exe}

Propositional attitudes may also, as in (\ref{ex:13-139}), be expressed as noun complementation, the general structure remaining the same.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-139}
\gll asíi xiaál ki [ɡóo mheeríl-u hée$\sim$ta  khóol-u] thaní \\

\glt `We thought that he had been killed and eaten [lit. Our opinion was that: ``If he has been killed, he has been eaten''].' (A:GHA011) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Commentative predicates.} Commentative (or factive) predicates provide a~comment on a~complement proposition that is assumed to be real \citep[117]{noonan1985}. Again, the distinction between these and utterance predicates is not always very obvious, as the complement often occurs as reported discourse, and there is probably quite some overlap. Typically, the complement clause is formed as a~question, with \textit{keé} `why' in (\ref{ex:13-140}) and \textit{kateeṇí} `what kind' in (\ref{ex:13-141}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-140}
\gll so hairán bhíl-u ki [aṛé čhéelí  du"=khur-áam ǰhulí keé uth-í hín-i] thaní \\
\textsc{3msg.nom}  surprised become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{comp} \textsc{dist} goat  two"=leg-\textsc{pl.ob} on why stand.up-\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs-f} \textsc{qt} \\
\glt `He was surprised that the goat was standing up on two feet.' (B:SHB724)

\ex
\label{ex:13-141}
\gll dun-áaṭ-u bhíl-u hín-u ki  [aní ba kateeṇ-í ǰuwánd] \\
think-\textsc{ag"=msg} become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \textsc{comp}  \textsc{3fsg.prox.nom} \textsc{prt} what.kind-\textsc{f} life  \\
\glt `He started wondering what kind of life this was.' (A:KAT057) 
\end{exe}

When the subject of the complement clause and the matrix clause are coreferent, as in (\ref{ex:13-142}), the complement can occur as a~Verbal Noun (strategy~(v)).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-142}
\gll lhoomée [teeṇíi taalím man"=ainíi] šárum  dac̣h-íi de \\
fox.\textsc{ob} \textsc{ refl} education say-\textsc{vn} shame look-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The fox was ashamed of talking about his own education.' (B:FOY) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Predicates of knowledge acquisition.} Many complement"=taking predicates having to do with acquisition of knowledge, use the same strategies as for utterances, and again the complement is presented as an~utterance (either by the agent of matrix clause, as in (\ref{ex:13-143}), or by some other, explicit or implicit, source participant, as in (\ref{ex:13-144}) and (\ref{ex:13-145})), whether it is literally and verbally uttered or is merely cognitively processed, i.e. ``uttered'' mind"=internally. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-143}
\gll \label{bkm:Ref190835538}búd-a hín-a ki [phaí wíi-a  ɡíi] thaní \\

\glt `They understood that the girl must have thrown herself into the water.' (A:SHY060)

\label{ex:13-144}

\glt `A month later he [the king] was informed that the ruler of Shishi had helped his [the king's] enemy to the territory of the prince [of Dir].' (B:ATI030-1)

\ex
\label{ex:13-145}
\gll \label{bkm:Ref190835565}tíi ṣúunt-u de ki, zanɡal-íi zinaawur-óom  díi [insaán thaní áa šái hín-u\textbf{...}] thaní \\

\glt `He heard from the beasts of the forest, that a~thing called ``man''....' (A:KIN002-4) 
\end{exe}

In examples (\ref{ex:13-143})--(\ref{ex:13-145}) the complement is presented as an~already uttered proposition, but even when the~-- assumedly verbal or cognitive~-- knowledge is still to be obtained, as perceived by the subject of the matrix clause, the same structure is being utilised, which can be seen in (\ref{ex:13-146}) but now without the final \textit{thaní}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-146}
\gll so insaán bulaḍ-íim bíi de páand-a  pharé ki [so insaán kateeṇ-ú

\glt `He went ahead to find out what kind of thing man is.' (A:KIN004) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Immediate perception predicates.} With at least two verbs coding directly perceived events, \textit{dac̣h-} `look, see' (in (\ref{ex:13-147})--(\ref{ex:13-148})) and \textit{dhay-} `watch, note' (the latter only in B., (\ref{ex:13-149})), another construction is regularly used (strategy~(iv)), in which the finite complement"=taking predicate occurs with a~particle \textit{ta}, followed by a~finite complement clause, i.e. the same construction used in the chaining of different"=subject clauses (see \sectref{sec:13-4}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-147}
\gll huṇḍɡiraá dac̣h-íin ta [iṇc̣ muṭ-íi phúṭi ǰhulí  bheš-í áaṇc̣-a khiáan-u] \\

\glt `They were looking up and saw the bear sitting in the top of the tree eating rasberries.' (A:KAT145)

\ex

\glt `They saw that he was indeed Khosh Shah's uncle.' (A:JAN056)

\glt `Kakel noted that two fairies came to sweep those shrines.' (B:FOR030) 
\end{exe}

It should be especially noted that while all the complements with PCU"=predicates exemplified in the previous sections represented direct discourse, the perceived event presented with this particular construction is indirect. Had it been presented as from the view of the experiencer in the matrix clause, the pronoun used in (\ref{ex:13-150}) would have been \textit{míi} `my' and not \textit{tasíi} `her'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-150}
\gll so šái ɡaḍ-í dac̣h-íi ta [tasíi  dít-i whaáu rumiaál hín-i] \\

\glt `Taking up the thing, she saw that it was the handkerchief she had given.' (A:SHY054)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Complement"=taking modality predicates}
\label{subsec:13-5-2}

\spitzmarke{Modal predicates.} As modality is part of the TMA system as a~whole and is expressed morphologically, there are few examples of complement"=taking predicates with a~purely modal meaning. However, one such predicate is \textit{bha-} `be able to, can', illustrated in (\ref{ex:13-151}). This verb regularly takes an~infinitival complement, a~strategy (vi), as far as my data is concerned, confined to this modal verb and the phasal verb \textit{ṣáat-} (see \textbf{Phasal predicates} down below).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-151}
\gll se har deés akaadúi paš-áai bhóon de  \\
\textsc{3pl.nom} every day \textsc{recp} see-\textsc{inf} be.able.to.\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `They were able to meet every day.' (A:SHY007) 
\end{exe}

That this verb is relatively morphologised as a~potentialis marker is indicated by its loss of inherent transitivity (otherwise highly unusual in the language). It is instead the complement verb that makes the whole sentence transitive or intransitive and also governs case assignment, whereas morphological verb agreement is part of the modal segment. In the perfective transitive sentence (\ref{ex:13-152}), the agent of `eating' is coded in the ergative, and \textit{bhá-} agrees in gender and number with `meat' (masculine singular) as if it were a~transitive verb. In (\ref{ex:13-153}), which is also perfective transitive, the verb agrees in gender and number with the agreeing host element `endurance' (feminine singular). In (\ref{ex:13-154}), however, the sentence as a~whole is (perfective) intransitive, and the subject of `going' is coded in the nominative and agrees intransitively with \textit{bhá-} in gender and number.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-152}
\gll asím pileeṭ-íi buṭheé mhaás kháai bhóol-u \\
\textsc{1pl.erg} plate-\textsc{gn} all meat eat.\textsc{inf} be.able.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `We were able to eat all the meat on the plates.' (A:CHE070920)

\ex
\label{ex:13-153}
\gll súun-a be ba teeṇíi doost-íi  ǰuda-í bardaáš na th-ái bhéel-i \\
pasture-\textsc{ob} go.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{refl} friend-\textsc{gn} separation-\textsc{gn} endurance \textsc{neg} do-\textsc{inf} be.able.\textsc{pfv-f}  \\
\glt `When he had gone to the high pasture, he could not bear the separation from his friend.' (B:FLW777)

\ex
\label{ex:13-154}
\gll ma atshareet-á the na báai bhóol-u  \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} Ashret-\textsc{ob} to \textsc{neg} go.\textsc{inf} be.able.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `I was not able to go to Ashret.' (A:CHN070104) 
\end{exe}

That this exemplifies clause union rather than a~full lexical union is supported by the fact that it is still possibile to split the two predicates and insert other constituents between them, as in (\ref{ex:13-155}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-155}
\gll ɡa manáa ba koó na bhóon de  \\
anything say.\textsc{inf} \textsc{prt} who \textsc{neg} be.able.\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst}  \\
\glt `Noone could tell them.' (A:JAN021) 
\end{exe}

Necessity or ablility can also be expressed with complement clauses of complement"=taking nouns. In those cases, the Verbal Noun strategy (v) is used. This is exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-156})--(\ref{ex:13-159}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-156}
\gll bíiḍ-i čitíl-i, xu [kuhée wée yúu   nikh"=aníi] ɡa čal na léed-i  \\
much-\textsc{f} think.\textsc{pfv-f} but well.\textsc{ob} in from  come.out-\textsc{vn} any trick \textsc{neg} find.\textsc{pfv-f}  \\
\glt `She thought a~lot, but there was no way of getting out of the well.' (B:FOX)

\ex
\label{ex:13-157}
\gll [putríi ǰhaní thainií] zarurí bháanu \\
son-\textsc{gn} marriage do.\textsc{vn} necessity become.\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `It is necessary to get one's son married [lit. It becomes a~necessity to make a~son's marriage].' (A:MAR009)

\ex
\label{ex:13-158}
\gll [muloó haans"=ainií] bíiḍ-u zarurí \\
mullah stay-\textsc{vn}  much-\textsc{msg} necessity  \\
\glt `A mullah must be present.' (A:MAR042)

\ex
\label{ex:13-159}
\gll típa [las haár dainií] asíi mooqá  hín-u \\
now \textsc{3sg.dist.acc} defeat give.\textsc{vn} \textsc{1pl.gn} opportunity be.\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `Now we can defeat him [lit. Now is our opportunity to defeat him].' (A:BEZ070) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Achievement predicates.} Although it is sometimes difficult to draw a~definite line between modal predicates of the ability type presented above and achievement predicates, the main difference in the typical cases lies in implicativity. While the modals above are non"=implicative, achievement predicates are implicative, i.e. signalling successful vs. failed performance/realisation. In any case, the Verbal Noun strategy seems to be, if not the only possible, at least the preferred one. Examples are given in (\ref{ex:13-160})--(\ref{ex:13-161}). Some achievement predicates require a~postposition with the Verbal Noun.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-160}
\gll tíi [dhoóṛ yhainií] koošíš thíil-i \\
\textsc{3sg.ob} yesterday come.\textsc{vn} attempt do.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `He tried to come yesterday.' (A:Q9.1102)

\ex
\label{ex:13-161}
\gll pirsaahib-á ba inkaár thíil-i [so phoó  deníi díi] \\
Pir.Sahib-\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} refusal do.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{def.msg.nom} boy  give.\textsc{vn} from \\
\glt `Pir Sahib refused to hand over the boy.' (B:ATI062)

\ex
\label{ex:13-162}
\gll eesé mehfil-í wée [rhoó dainií] ma  aamúuṣ-um de \\
\textsc{rem} gathering-\textsc{ob} in song give.\textsc{vn} \textsc{1sg.nom} forget-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `In that crowd I forgot to sing a~song.' (A:PHN5101.20) 
\end{exe}

Normally the Verbal Noun complement is embedded into the matrix clause. The complement in (\ref{ex:13-161}), however, occurs after the matrix clause and is thus added explanatorily rather than being extraposed in a~strict sense.


As is clear from examples (\ref{ex:13-163})--(\ref{ex:13-165}), achievement (or non"=achievement) can also be expressed with complement clauses of complement"=taking adjectives.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-163}
\gll [nis phus"=ainií] askóon \\
\textsc{3sg.prox.acc} rid-\textsc{vn} easy \\
\glt `It will be easy to get rid of him.' (A:UXB019)

\ex
\label{ex:13-164}

\glt `They managed to meet each other throughout the winter.' (A:SHY006) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Phasal predicates.} As was also pointed out above concerning modals, many phasal notions, having to do with termination and continuation, are indicated by means other than complementation, and probably mainly so. Inception, however, can be expressed with at least two different complementation strategies.


One of those strategies is infinitival (vi), whereby the Perfective form \textit{ṣáat-} of the polysemous verb \textit{ṣač-} `climb, etc.' is utilised (\ref{ex:13-166}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-166}
\gll káakeṛ teeṇíi kúṛi-e pándee kaantar-í ba  [biabeen-íim ɡir-áa] ṣáat-u \\
Kakel \textsc{ refl} woman-\textsc{gn} cause go.mad-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt}  wilderness-\textsc{pl.ob} turn-\textsc{inf} begin.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Kakel went mad due to this with his wife and began wandering about in the wilderness.' (B:FOR020) 
\end{exe}

Unlike the Infinitive"=taking modal \textit{bha-} (see \textbf{Modal predicates} above), \textit{ṣáat-} is confined to the Perfective and remains intransitive, regardless of the transitivity of the complement predicate. In (\ref{ex:13-167}), with an~intransitive complement, as well as in (\ref{ex:13-168}), with a~transitive complement, the phasal verb agrees in gender and number with the subject of the matrix clause.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-167}
\gll ɣalí bhe [padúši padúši bay-áa] ṣéet-i  \\
silent become.\textsc{cv} behind behind go-\textsc{inf} begin.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `Silently she started to lag far behind.' (B:FOY)

\ex
\label{ex:13-168}
\gll whaid-í ba [haṛé ziaarat-íim díi  muaaf-í daway-áa] ṣáat-u \\
fall.down-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{dist} shrine-\textsc{pl.ob} from forgiveness-\textsc{pl} ask-\textsc{inf} begin.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `Having fallen down, he started to beg forgiveness from those shrines.' (B:FOR039) 
\end{exe}

Although the construction is a~possible example of clause union, \textit{ṣáat-} seems not to have morphologised to the same extent as \textit{bha-}, evidenced also in the parallel use of a~Verbal Noun (\ref{ex:13-169}) with it instead of an~Infinitive. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-169}
\gll ak čoór tesée ɡhooṣṭ-á ačíit-u. [ɡhoóṣṭ  laṭ-ainíi] ṣáat-u \\
\textsc{idef} thief \textsc{3sg.gn} house-\textsc{ob} enter.\textsc{pfv"=msg} house search-\textsc{vn} begin.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `A thief entered his house. He started to search through the house.' (B:THI) 
\end{exe}

With another nearly synonymous phasal predicate \textit{široó the-}, exemplified in (\ref{ex:13-170}), the Verbal Noun strategy is the only possible one.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-170}
\gll se ṭhaaṭáak-a bi [tas sanɡí khainií]  široó thíil-u \\
\textsc{def} monster-\textsc{ob} also \textsc{3sg.acc} with eat.\textsc{vn} start do.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `The monster also started to eat together with him.' (A:THA007) 
\end{exe}

There is evidence, although scanty, that the phasal notion of continuation can be expressed through two (for the purpose) less usual strategies with the complement"=taking predicate \textit{dhar-} `remain', one being a~Converb (\ref{ex:13-171}) and the other a~Copredicative Participle (\ref{ex:13-172}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-171}
\gll míḍ-ee ɡúu [dac̣h-í] dharíit-a \\
ram-\textsc{cnj} bull look-\textsc{cv} remain.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `The ram and the bull remained (=stood for a~long time) looking.' (B:SHI018)

\ex
\label{ex:13-172}
\gll [mée$\sim$ mée$\sim$ the-íim] dharíit-i  \\
baa baa do-\textsc{cprd} remain.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `She kept bleating.' (B:FOX) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Desiderative predicates.} The Verbal Noun strategy is also put to use in
subject"=controlled complements of desiderative predicates, as in
(\ref{ex:13-173})--(\ref{ex:13-177}). The Verbal Noun may also be inflected
(\ref{ex:2-7})\authcomm{Just to be on the safe side: Is the reference to example (\ref{ex:2-7})
  correct? Or did you mean to refer to one of the examples below this paragraph?}  or followed by
a~postposition (\ref{ex:13-177}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-173}
\gll se [har deés akaadúi paš-ainií] dawóon de \\
\textsc{3pl.nom} every day \textsc{recp} see-\textsc{vn} ask.\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `They wanted to meet each other every day.' (A:SHY004)

\ex
\label{ex:13-174}
\gll eeṛé wáǰa ǰhulí alataalaá [tas dubaará dunyay-í  the phray"=ainií] iraadá thíil-u \\

\glt `Therefore, Allah Almighty decided to send him another time to the world.' (A:ABO030)

\ex
\label{ex:13-175}
\gll [neečíir theníi-a] díiš-a xalk-íim xwaaíš thíil-i \\

\glt `People in the village wanted to go hunting.' (B:AVA200) \\

\ex
\label{ex:13-176}
\gll [tas the kúṛi dawainií] bandubás tháan-u \\
\textsc{3sg.acc} to woman ask.\textsc{vn}  arrangement do.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `He arranges to have his son married.' (A:MAR004)

\ex
\label{ex:13-177}
\gll be [teeṇíi se neečíir bhaaɡ-aníi ǰhulí]  raazí bhíl-a \\
\textsc{1pl.nom} \textsc{refl} \textsc{def} hunt divide-\textsc{vn} on agreeable become.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `We have agreed on the division of our game.' (B:FOY) 
\end{exe}

Finally, as pointed out already, some utterance predicates, using the \textit{ki}-strategy, especially those concerning ``thinking'', can equally well be considered desiderative.


\subsection{Complement"=taking manipulation predicates}
\label{subsec:13-5-3}

\spitzmarke{Permissive predicates.} When the verb \textit{uṛí-} `pour, let out' is used as the complement"=taking verb `let', it occurs in two different constructions, both with permissive semantics. One is the Verbal Noun strategy ((v)), also occurring in various other complement clauses (see \sectref{subsec:13-5-1}), followed by the postposition \textit{the} `to', as shown in (\ref{ex:13-178}) and (\ref{ex:13-179}). This is used in the indicative.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-178}
\gll uc̣hí ba se čúti-m-e zaríia báandi  so baṭ huṇṭeɡiraák uc̣hí
ɡal-áan-u [se kúuk-a se muṭ-á bheš-aníi the] na  uṛ-áan-u \textsc{[}mhaás
  khainíi the] na uṛ-áan-u \\
lift.up.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{def} paw-\textsc{pl"=gn} means on  \textsc{def.msg.nom} stone upward lift.up.\textsc{cv} throw-\textsc{prs"=msg}  \textsc{def} crow-\textsc{pl} \textsc{def} tree-\textsc{ob} sit.down-\textsc{vn} to \textsc{neg} let-\textsc{prs"=msg} meat eat.\textsc{vn} to \textsc{neg} let-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `After picking up he is throwing up the stone with the help of his paws, not letting the crows sit down in the tree, or eat the meat.' (B:SHB752-6)

\ex
\label{ex:13-179}
\gll ɡhaḍeeró miṭínɡ xátum bhíl-ii pahúrta [asaám  bainií the] uṛ-íi-ee \\
elder meeting finished become.\textsc{pptc"=gn} after \textsc{1pl.acc} go.\textsc{vn} to let-\textsc{3sg-q} \\
\glt `Will the elder let us leave after the meeting is over?' (A:Q6.29.07) 
\end{exe}

Note that the manipulee of the main verb is coreferent with the agent of the complement verb but is assigned case by the main verb, thus coded accusatively in (\ref{ex:13-179}).


The other strategy, involving the particle \textit{ta} (iv), is used in the Imperative, with the literal rendering `let x (out), and x will do y'. Whereas in the strategy above the complement clause is embedded, the complement clause in this construction, seen in (\ref{ex:13-180}), is S-like and extraposed. The main verb does not assign case to the manipulee/complement clause agent in this construction.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-180}
\gll ṛo uṛí ta [rhoó d-íi] \\
\textsc{3sg.dist.nom} let.\textsc{imp.sg} \textsc{ prt} song give-\textsc{3sg} \\
\glt `Let him sing!' (A:Q6.15.02) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{Causative predicates.} While the most important means of expressing causativity is morphological~-- a~matter we will return to shortly~-- manipulation that involves a~lower degree of agentive control \citep[45]{givon2001b} is often expressed through what is basically utterance predicates, also using the same strategies. Examples are given in (\ref{ex:13-181})--(\ref{ex:13-183}). Hereby the manner of causation or persuation is also made explicit \citep[126]{noonan1985}. The complement clause is either imperative or hortative.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-181}
\gll tas the ṭeekíl-u ki [nikhá c̣híitr-a  kráam-a the báaya] thaní \\
\textsc{3sg.acc} to call.out.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{comp} come.out.\textsc{imp.sg} field-\textsc{ob}  work-\textsc{ob} to go.\textsc{1pl} \textsc{qt} \\
\glt `He called out to her to come out and go with him to work in the field.' (A:WOM638)

\ex
\label{ex:13-182}
\gll yheyí se kuṇaak-á the išaará thíil-u  ki [ma khúna yha] thaní \\
come.\textsc{cv} \textsc{def} child-\textsc{ob} to signal do.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{comp} \textsc{1sg.nom} near come.\textsc{imp.sg} \textsc{qt} \\
\glt `Coming there, he signalled to the child to come to him.' (A:BER003)

\ex
\label{ex:13-183}
\gll deewúl-ii xálak"=am daawát dít-i  atsharíit"=am the ki [muqaabilá
  th-íia]  (thaníit-u ta) \\
Dir-\textsc{gn}  people-\textsc{pl.ob} invitation give.\textsc{pfv-f} Ashreti-\textsc{pl.ob} to \textsc{comp} contest do-\textsc{1pl} say.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} \\
\glt `The people of Dir invited the Ashretis to compete with them.' (A:CHA001) 
\end{exe}

When, however, agent control is strong, the preferred strategy is to utilise the morphological causative construction \textit{per se}. This can either be in the form of direct causation, in essence deriving a~transitive verb from an~intransitive (such as `make sit down, seat' from `sit down' in (\ref{ex:13-184}) and `hang (something)' from `hang (by itself)' in (\ref{ex:13-185})), or in the form of indirect causation (such as `have (someone) drink' from `drink' in (\ref{ex:13-185}), `have someone tell' from `tell something' in (\ref{ex:13-186}) and `have someone educated' from `educate (oneself)' in (\ref{ex:13-187})). With indirect causation, an~animate manipulee is marked by \textit{ṣaawaá}, a~grammaticalisation of the Converb of \textit{ṣaawá-} `put on, dress, turn on'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-184}
\gll eesé zanɡal-í áa baṭ-á ǰhulí har-í  so kuṇaák bhešóol-u \\

\glt `He took him to a~stone in the forest and put him down (i.e. had him sit).' (A:BRE005)

\glt `In the winter we hang oak branches for her [the goat] during the night, and in the day we take her to drink plenty of water in beautiful places.' (A:KEE091)

\ex
\label{ex:13-186}
\gll xalk-íim ṣaawaá teér bhíl-a qiseé  tha-wóol-a \\

\glt `He had the people tell him all that had happened.' (A:UXW057)

\ex
\label{ex:13-187}
\gll áa putr-á ṣaawaá ma taalím tha-wáain-u  \\
\textsc{idef} son-\textsc{ob} \textsc{manip} \textsc{1sg.nom} education do-\textsc{caus}.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `I'm having one of my sons educated' (A:KEE082) 
\end{exe}

In this construction, clause union is complete, and we can also define it as a~total lexical union \citep[75]{noonan1985} or co"=lexicalisation of the ``cause'' and the ``caused event''. This is therefore not in a~strict sense an~instance of complementation.


\section{Relative clauses}
\label{sec:13-6}

Relativisation in Palula offers an~unusual analytical challenge, partly due to the many different strategies that seem to be available, partly due to their relative scarcity in natural discourse, whether spoken or written. 



Generally speaking, the unmarked relative clause (or its functional equivalent) is preposed to the modified NP as well as the main clause in its entirety. Although there is a~preference for co"=relative (also referred to as relative"=correlative) constructions, as described by \citet{downing1974}, most of them are not of the kind typical of major IA languages \citep[410--415]{masica1991}, which is why I have chosen not to use the term other than in comparison with the more ``typical'' IA pattern. Neither does Palula share the general Shina preference for participial relative clauses (Carla Radloff, pc.), possibly a~result of the synchronic non"=distinctiveness in Palula between many participles and the finite verb forms historically derived from the former.



There is no attempt on my side to reflect the relative frequency of occurrence by the order with which the various strategies and types of relativisation are outlined below. The number of examples of relative clauses is basically too low to present any reliable statistics. Extraposition with \textit{ki} (\sectref{subsec:13-6-7}) is not strictly a~separate type of relative clause but rather an~additional, but nevertheless frequently used, strategy, primarily related to presentational structure and other pragmatic functions.



Restrictive and non"=restrictive relative clauses overlap to a~large extent, although it seems that extraposed clauses are favoured with non"=restrictive clauses.


\subsection{Relative clauses with a~full NP}
\label{subsec:13-6-1}


Most similar to the typical Urdu"=Hindi relative"=correlative construction are those sentences that have a~full NP in a~preposed modifying clause corresponding to a~full NP in the main clause. In (\ref{ex:13-188})--(\ref{ex:13-189}), the otherwise interrogatively used \textit{khayí} `which' is used as an~adnominal relative pronoun, correlating with a~demonstrative from the remote set. Although the noun can be repeated in full in the main clause along with a~demonstrative, it can equally well be coreferenced by a~demonstrative alone.



Whereas the modifying clause is dependent on the main clause for its interpretation, the main (indicative and finite) clause can in most cases stand alone as a~complete sentence. The modifying (relative) clause occurring on its own (which is not always possible due to a~non"=basic word order), however, would be interpretable as a~content question rather than as a~statement. Following \citet[182]{givon2001b}, a~construction like this is essentially paratactic, the linking device between the two clauses being deictic rather than a~matter of subordination or embedding.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-188}
\gll [baába khayí xarčá dawóol-u hín-u]  eesó xarčá ɡhin-í{\ldots}  \\
father.\textsc{ob} which expenditure ask.for.\textsc{pfv"=msg} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \textsc{rem.msg.nom} expenditure take-\textsc{cv} \\
\glt `Taking the reimbursement, which the father has demanded{\ldots}' (A:MAR037-8)

\ex
\label{ex:13-189}
\gll [se baaqimaandá mehmaan-aán khayí hín-a  práač-a khayí hín-a]
eetanaám the ɡúuli d-áan-a \\
\textsc{def} additional guest-\textsc{pl} which be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} guest-\textsc{pl} which be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \textsc{3pl.acc} to bread give-\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `We feed those other guests who are present.' (A:MIT024) 
\end{exe}

Some modifying clauses with adnominal \textit{khayí} are possibly embedded rather than preposed, as in (\ref{ex:13-190}), where we may further suggest that a~noun \textit{xálak} `people' is the implicit head. However, the analysis is still pending in anticipation of more natural data of a~similar kind. It should also be noted that a~pronoun \textit{ni} `they (here)' from the proximate set is being used and not one from the usual remote set.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-190}
\gll tipúka ni ba khayí hín-a  dhii-á díi khooǰainií zarurí bh-áan-u \\
nowadays \textsc{3pl.prox.nom} \textsc{prt} which be.\textsc{prs"=mpl}  daughter-\textsc{ob} from ask.\textsc{vn} necessity become-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `Nowadays there are those, for whom it is necessary to ask their daughter [who she wants to be married to]' (A:MAR019) 
\end{exe}

In (\ref{ex:13-191}), the relative clause is probably internal. Note that the construction as a~whole is extraposed to the temporal clause.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-191}
\gll paturaá nuuṭíl-u ta [khayí zhay-í wée] asím  ǰinaazá khaṣeel-í wheelíl-u de \\
back return.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} which place-\textsc{ob} in \textsc{1pl.erg} corpse drag-\textsc{cv}  bring.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{pst}   \\
\glt `When I returned to the place to where we had dragged him down{\ldots}' (A:GHA044)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Indefinite"=conditional relative clauses}
\label{subsec:13-6-2}

Quite similar to, and possibly not altogether distinct from, the relative clauses above are those that contain an~interrogative pronoun in combination with (or even fused with) an~indefinite word \textit{ɡalá} \textit{(B. ɡalé)} meaning `ever'. The resulting meaning is something like `whoever, whatever', referring to one in a~group of potential referents having a~non"=specific reference. The relative clause is often a~conditional clause, and is therefore more clearly subordinate than the above described construction, and the correlative in the main clause is referred to with a~demonstrative or personal pronoun from the remote set (if at all explicit). Examples are given in (\ref{ex:13-192})--(\ref{ex:13-194}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-192}
\gll [kasée ɡalé maáṭu dhraǰaá ba šúul-a the  phedíl-u hée$\sim$ta] hasó kh-úu \\
who.\textsc{gn} ever neck stretch.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} sheaf-\textsc{ob} to  reach.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condl} \textsc{3msg.rem.nom} eat-\textsc{3sg} \\
\glt `The one (of us) whose neck can reach the sheaf shall eat.' (B:SHI016)

\ex
\label{ex:13-193}
\gll [anú íṇc̣-a sanɡí mháala kií ɡalá ɡhašíl-i  hée$\sim$ta] ma tas
the páanǰ sóo rupeé baxšíš  d-áan-u \\
\textsc{prox.msg.nom}{\protect\footnotemark} bear-\textsc{ob} with wrestling who.\textsc{ob} ever grab.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{condl} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{3sg.acc} to five hundred rupee.\textsc{pl} reward give-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `I will give 500 rupees to whoever wrestles with this bear' (A:BEW003)

\ex
\label{ex:13-194}
\gll [ṣiúul-a ɡubáa ɡalé maníit-u ta] lhooméi kaṇ  th-íi de \\
jackal-\textsc{ob} what ever say.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} fox ear do-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `Whatever the jackal told him, the fox gave heed to.' (B:FOY) 
\end{exe}

\footnotetext{The form of the determiner is not the expected one, since the head is non"=nominative.}


The relativised NP can thus be a~possessor, an~ergative subject or a~direct object. It does not even need to be a~noun phrase thus being relativised; the same basic construction is used in some temporal clauses with \textit{kareé ɡalá} `whenever' (see \sectref{subsec:13-4-1}), then always without an~explicit correlative.


When the noun phrase being relativised is a~nominative subject, as in (\ref{ex:13-195}), \textit{ɡalá} does not seem to be necessary to include. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-195}
\gll [koó eesé ṭeem-íi haazír na heensíl-u  hée$\sim$ta] tasíi mux-íi nikh"=aaṇḍeéu bh-áan-u \\
who.\textsc{nom} \textsc{dist} time-\textsc{gn} presence \textsc{neg} stay.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \textsc{condl } \textsc{3sg.gn} face-\textsc{gn} come.out-\textsc{oblg} become-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `The one (of them) who was not present at that time, will have to come (later) and greet./If one of them was not present at that time, he will have to come (later) and greet.' (A:MAR048-9)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Gapped relative clauses}
\label{subsec:13-6-3}


What seems to be a~major strategy for relativisation is a~preposed gapped modifying clause, i.e. one in which the relativised NP is not explicitly present at all. Even here the correlative NP in the main clause often occurs with a~demonstrative from the remote set, thus in essence being of the same kind as the relative"=correlative construction we have seen examples of already.


The modifying clause may be indicative finite, as in examples (\ref{ex:13-196})--(\ref{ex:13-199}), with the positions direct object, oblique object coding source and transitive subject, as well as the oblique object coding recipient being relativised.

\begin{exe}

\glt `The boy whom I gave my keys has disappeared.' (A:HLE3053) 
\end{exe}

It may also occur as a~preposed conditional clause, in (\ref{ex:13-200}) relativising the possessor NP.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-200}
\gll [áaṛu heensíl-u hée$\sim$ta] eesó ḍhínɡar aayindá  dapáara nakaám bh-áan-u  \\
knot stay.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{condl} \textsc{rem.msg.nom} timber future  for failed become-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `Timber, which has knots will be worthless in the future/If it is knotty, the timber will fail in the future.' (A:HOW032) 
\end{exe}

Another possibility, seen in (\ref{ex:13-201}) and (\ref{ex:13-202}), is to use preposed dependent Converb clauses for relativisation.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-201}
\gll [preeṣaá ba] eetás the ta man-áan-a  kaašméeṇi \\
squeeze.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{3sg.acc} to \textsc{prt} say-\textsc{prs"=mpl}  ``kashmeeni'' \\
\glt `That, which is squeezed out, is called ``kashmeeni''' (A:KEE055)

\ex
\label{ex:13-202}
\gll [tas mheer-í ɡal-í] zaalim"=aan-óom dhút-a  pharé ɡúuli bi de ɡíia de \\
\textsc{3sg.acc} kill-\textsc{cv} throw-\textsc{cv} brute-\textsc{pl"=ob} mouth-\textsc{ob}  toward bread also put.\textsc{cv} go.\textsc{pfv.pl} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The brutes, who had killed him, had also put bread in his mouth and left.' (A:GHA076-7) 
\end{exe}

A reflexive pronoun, as in (\ref{ex:13-203}), can also occur in the modifying clause. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-203}
\gll [teṇ teeṇíi násel pašaá ba] muxaák hasó  tshaak-íi \\
\textsc{refl} \textsc{refl} descent show.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} before \textsc{3msg.rem.nom}  taste-\textsc{3sg} \\
\glt `The one who is able to prove his noble heritage may taste first.' (B:SHI006) 
\end{exe}

Some constructions that technically are relativisations with a~preposed Converb clause are lexicalised to a~large extent, and function as standard presentational constructions when new participants or places are being introduced into a~discourse. Note in (\ref{ex:13-204}) that the coreferential noun phrases in the main clause are indefinite.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-204}
\gll muxaák zamanée [čakaaḍhám than-í] ak díiš-a  [kaakeṛ than-í] ak méeš heensíl-u de  \\
before time.\textsc{gn} Chakadham call-\textsc{cv} \textsc{idef} village-\textsc{ob}  Kakel call-\textsc{cv} \textsc{idef} man stay.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `Once there lived in the village Chakadham a~man called Kakel.' (B:FOR001)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Gapped relative clauses with a~complementiser}
\label{subsec:13-6-4}


Sometimes in gapped relative clauses, a~particle \textit{ɡa} is used as a~complementiser or relativiser, otherwise occurring as an~indefinite (`some', `any') or an~adnominal interrogative (`what', `what kind of') pronoun. This particle or word is invariable and thus is not coreferential with the modified NP. Instead it seems to merely mark the modifying clause vis-à-vis the main clause. Examples are given in (\ref{ex:13-205})--(\ref{ex:13-208}).


There does not seem to be any significant covariation between the presence of this marker and any particular position being relativised, although it possibly is used more readily (and maybe even non"=optionally) when an~oblique constituent is relativised, such as the location in (\ref{ex:13-207}) and (\ref{ex:13-208}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-205}
\gll [aṛé íṇc̣-a ǰhulí ɡa hín-u] eeṛó  míiš-ee \\
\textsc{dist} bear-\textsc{ob} on \textsc{rel} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \textsc{dist.msg.nom}   man-\textsc{q} \\
\glt `Is it the man who is sitting on the bear?' (A:BEZ012)

\ex
\label{ex:13-206}
\gll [míi dhií ɡa saat-éen-i] eení kúṛi  aní buṭheé šaak-á aṭíl-a \\
\textsc{1sg.gn} daughter \textsc{rel} take.care.of-\textsc{prs-f} \textsc{prox} woman \textsc{prox} all wood-\textsc{pl} bring.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `This woman, who is taking care of my daughter, brought all this firewood' (A:REQ17)

\ex
\label{ex:13-207}
\gll [máa-ee tu ɡa bheš-í hín-a]  aní ɡhooṣṭ-á šíiṭi \\
\textsc{1sg.nom"=cnj} \textsc{2sg.nom} \textsc{rel} sit.down-\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \textsc{prox} house-\textsc{ob} inside  \\
\glt `In the house where you and I are sitting...' (A:HUA014)

\ex
\label{ex:13-208}
\gll \label{bkm:Ref190845659}[henrík de ɡa ɡíia] eeṛáa rhalá ba  qilaá de \\
Henrik put.\textsc{cv} \textsc{rel} go.\textsc{pfv.pl}  there above \textsc{prt} fort be.\textsc{pst } \\
\glt `Above [the place] where you took Henrik, there was a~fort.' (A:CAV004) 
\end{exe}

The position of \textit{ɡa} is probably preverbal, but further investigation is needed to say with more certainty. In (\ref{ex:13-209}), the modifying clause is postposed, and here \textit{ɡa} occurs clause"=initially.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-209}
\gll eé kučúru [ɡa so wíi ǰhuṭá thíil-u]  \\
oh! dog \textsc{rel} \textsc{def.msg.nom} water dirty do.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `It must be the dog that has contaminated the water' (A:PAS038) 
\end{exe}

In (\ref{ex:13-210}), the modifying string `who used to walk with the millstone' seems to function simultaneously as a~postposed non"=restrictive relative clause to `the Dameli strong man' and as a~preposed restrictive relative"=correlative clause to `that (one) didn't take up the challenge'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-210}
\gll so ɡiḍúuču paalawaáṇ [so yambaáṭ  ɡa ɡhin-í b-íi de] eesó na  ṣandíl-u maní \\
\textsc{def.msg.nom} Dameli.man strong.man \textsc{def} mill.stone \textsc{rel} take-\textsc{cv} go-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \textsc{3msg.rem.nom} \textsc{neg} take.up.challenge.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{hsay} \\
\glt `The strong man of Damel, who used to walk with the millstone, apparently didn't take up the
challenge' (A:MAH054)
\end{exe}

The modifying clause in (\ref{ex:13-211}), beginning with \textit{ɡa}, takes as a~whole the place of the transitive subject. Tentatively it is analysed as a (headless) internal relative clause.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-211}
\gll bhunaṛíi wée [ɡa šáali ṭópa dít-i]  šáali khéel-i \\
down.below.ob in \textsc{rel} Shali downside give.\textsc{pfv-f} Shali eat.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `Down there, the one that caught Shali ate her.' (A:PAS059)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Pronominal relative clauses}
\label{subsec:13-6-5}


Some data (from B., and mostly elicited: (\ref{ex:13-212})--(\ref{ex:13-214})) suggests the possibility of regular anaphoric (personal or demonstrative) pronouns being used in the modifying clause, whether preposed or postposed. The evidence, however, is too scanty to draw any definite conclusions. Suffice to say that the positions being thus relativised are low on the accessibility hierarchy (postpositional object and possessor, respectively), which is fully in line with typological predictions \citep[147--148]{keenan1985}. On the other hand, we have examples of relativisation of recipient (\ref{ex:13-199}) as well as possessor (\ref{ex:13-200}) by gapping (although from A.).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-212}
\gll anú [dhoóṛ míi putr-á hanís the  kitaáb dít-i] hasó phoó  \\
\textsc{3msg.prox.nom} yesterday \textsc{1sg.gn} son-\textsc{ob} \textsc{3sg.prox.acc} to  book give.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{rem.msg.nom} boy \\
\glt `This is the boy who my son gave a~book to yesterday.' (B:DHE5367)

\ex
\label{ex:13-213}
\gll anú míi doóst [anisée ɡhooṣṭ-á the  dhoóṛ anú méeš ɡáu] \\
\textsc{3msg.prox.nom} \textsc{1sg.gn} friend \textsc{3sg.prox.gn} house"=ob to  yesterday \textsc{prox.msg.nom} man go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \\
\glt `This is my friend, whose house this man went to yesterday.' (B:DHE5373)

\ex
\label{ex:13-214}
\gll asím [so méeš ɡhašiǰíl-u baazúur-a  phará] so kuṇaák ba atesée
ɡhooṣṭ-á  the phreyíl-u \\
\textsc{1pl.erg} \textsc{def.msg.nom} man be.caught.\textsc{pfv"=msg} bazaar-\textsc{ob}  along \textsc{ def.msg.nom} child \textsc{prt} \textsc{3sg.rem.gn} house-\textsc{ob} to send.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `We sent the child to the house of the man who had been caught in the bazaar.' (B:ANG018) 
\end{exe}

Pronominals used in the modifying clause are otherwise, as we shall see, the normal case with so"=called extraposed \textit{ki}-constructions (see \sectref{subsec:13-6-7}). 


\subsection{Nominalisation and the use of participials}
\label{subsec:13-6-6}

A less"=accessible noun phrase may be expressed through nominalisation, whereby a~Verbal Noun becomes the possessor of the relativised entity. This seems to be especially common with time, location and means, as seen in (\ref{ex:13-215})--(\ref{ex:13-218}). The genitive case of the Verbal Noun is only explicitly present in the B. variety (\textit{-e}), whereas the genitive has been levelled in A.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-215}
\gll rhootašíi-a [ǰhambréeṛi har"=ainií] waxt  yhóol-u ta \\
morning-\textsc{ob} bride take.away-\textsc{vn} time come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{prt} \\
\glt `In the morning, at the time of taking the bride{\ldots}' (A:GHU010)

\ex
\label{ex:13-216}
\gll [máa-the bašéš deníi-e] zhay-í so  ma mhaar-áan-u \\
\textsc{1sg.nom}-to reward give.\textsc{inf"=gn} place-\textsc{ob} \textsc{3msg.nom} \textsc{1sg.nom} kill-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `He is going to kill me instead of rewarding me.' (B:DRB)

\ex
\label{ex:13-217}
\gll [bhíiru uṛ-ainií] tartíb ba eeṛé  \\
he.goat let.out-\textsc{inf} method \textsc{prt} \textsc{dist} \\
\glt `The method of letting out the he"=goat [to the she"=goats] is the following...' (A:KEE073)

\ex
\label{ex:13-218}
\gll ma tu the ɣeer-í šíiṭi be [neečíir  aṭaníi-e] baát d-áam \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{2sg.nom} to cave-\textsc{ob} inside go.\textsc{cv} game  bring.\textsc{inf"=gn} talk give-\textsc{1sg} \\
\glt `Once we have got into the cave, I will tell you about the catching of game.' (B:FOY) 
\end{exe}

Less commonly, Perfective Participials may be used attributively, as in (\ref{ex:13-219})--(\ref{ex:13-221}), and in those cases relativise the direct object. As an~additional means to distinguish the participial from the formally identical finite Perfective verb, an~explicit (but optional) participial marker (also referred to as an~adjectiviser in this work), such as \textit{bhaáu} in (\ref{ex:13-221}), can be used.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-219}
\gll phaí [teeṇíi háat"=am čooṇṭéel-i] rumiaál dít-i  hín-i \\
girl \textsc{refl} hand-\textsc{ins} embroider.\textsc{pptc-f} handkerchief give.\textsc{pfv-f} be.\textsc{prs-f} \\
\glt `The girl gave [him] the handkerchief which she herself had embroidered.' (A:SHY031)

\ex
\label{ex:13-220}
\gll xalk-íim ṣaawaá [teér bhíl-a] qiseé  thawóol-a \\
people-\textsc{pl.ob} \textsc{manip} passed become.\textsc{pptc"=mpl} story.\textsc{pl} make.do.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `He had the people tell him all that had happened.' (A:UXW057)

\ex
\label{ex:13-221}
\gll amzarái [muṛ-u-bhaáu] insaán na  kháain-u \\
lion die.\textsc{pptc"=msg"=adj} human.being \textsc{neg} eat.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `A lion doesn't eat a~human being which has died.' (A:UNF012) 
\end{exe}

A corresponding (headless) construction for relativising an~agent subject, is by using the Agentive Verbal Noun, as seen in (\ref{ex:13-222}), but neither does that seem to be a~very common strategy. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-222}
\gll [teewiz-í th-áaṭ-u] [ṛe pairaán ɡaḍ-í  ṣeekáaiṭ-u] \\
amulet-\textsc{pl} do-\textsc{ag"=msg} \textsc{dist} djinn.\textsc{pl} take.out-\textsc{cv} lead.out.\textsc{ag"=msg} \\
\glt `He was an~expert in making amulets and a~saviour from djinns.' (A:HUA129) 
\end{exe}

Alternatively, the Present tense verb is itself used without an~overt head, as in (\ref{ex:13-223}). This has an~implicit habituality read into it, whereas the corresponding non"=habitual meaning would have to be expressed with an~explicit correlative head (\ref{ex:13-224}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-223}
\gll [šaak-á aṭ-áan-u] čiiríit-u  \\
wood-\textsc{pl} bring-\textsc{prs"=msg} be.delayed.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `The person who [usually] brings the wood has been delayed' (A:HLE3051)

\ex
\label{ex:13-224}
\gll [šaak-á aṭ-áan-u] eesó phoó čiiríit-u  \\
wood-\textsc{pl} bring-\textsc{prs"=msg} \textsc{rem.ms}\textsc{g.}\textsc{nom} boy be.delayed.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `The boy who is bringing the wood has been delayed.' (A:HL3051)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Extraposed \textit{ki}-constructions}
\label{subsec:13-6-7}

The possibility of extraposing a~modifying clause is facilitated by the particle or complementiser \textit{ki} (see \sectref{subsec:13-5-1}). The sentences in (\ref{ex:13-225})--(\ref{ex:13-227}) are all elicited, and are thus not necessarily the most natural way of expressing these ideas. However, regarding them as a~general indication of grammaticality, we can conclude that the construction works for a~number of different positions. Note also that the emphatic or demonstrative pronoun is used in the main clause, whereas a~non"=emphatic anaphoric pronoun is used in the modifying \textit{ki-}clause, although the latter is optional for the subject position.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:13-225}
\gll anú eesó míiš ki [níi  se kúṛi mheeríl-i] \\
\textsc{3msg.prox.nom} \textsc{rem.msg.nom} man \textsc{comp} \textsc{3sg.prox.ob} \textsc{def} woman kill.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `This is the man who killed the woman.' (A:HLE2617)

\ex
\label{ex:13-226}
\gll anú eesó míiš ki [nisíi  ɡhooṣṭ-á ma hín-u] \\
\textsc{3msg.prox.nom} \textsc{rem.msg.nom} man \textsc{comp} \textsc{3sg.prox.gn} house-\textsc{ob} \textsc{1sg.nom} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `This is the man whose house I am [living] in.' (A:HLE2618)

\ex
\label{ex:13-227}
\gll anú eesó míiš ki [(nu)  dhoóṛ yhóol-u de] \\
\textsc{3msg.prox.nom} \textsc{rem.msg.nom} man \textsc{prt} \textsc{3msg.prox.nom} yesterday come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `This is the man who came yesterday.' (A:HLE2618) 
\end{exe}

It seems that the construction is particularly favoured in presentational discourse, and a~number of correlative expressions, belonging to various parts of speech, can be linked to an~extraposed \textit{ki}-clause, expressing a~variety of pragmatic- or discourse"=related functions (some of them touched upon when discussing clauses with adverbial functions (\sectref{sec:13-4}) and complementation (\sectref{sec:13-5})). In most cases, however, the \textit{ki}-clause as a~whole corresponds to the correlative in the main clause, rather than to a~particular relative word in it.
