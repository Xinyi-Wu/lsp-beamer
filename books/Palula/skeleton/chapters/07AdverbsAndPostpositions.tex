\section{Adverbs}
\label{sec:7-1}


Hardly surprising, adverbs and adverbial expressions comprise a~heterogenous category in Palula. Only a~few adverbs are entirely non"=derived (whether synchronically or diachronically speaking), and as a~word class, if it can at all be described as such, it is a~small, closed class rather than a~large, open one. Most spatial and temporal adverbs are pronominal or nominal, most manner adverbs are verbal and some members of the small subclass of degree adverbs are also used as modifiers of nouns. Many spatial adverbs are also used as postpositions. Still, as described in \sectref{subsec:6-3-4}, some adjectives are derived from the small group of non"=derived (primarily calendrical) adverbs.


\subsection{Symmetrical adverb sets}
\label{subsec:7-1-1}

The systematic differentiation between the categories `proximate', `distal', `remote' and `indefinite"=interrogative' among pronouns (and other pro"=forms; see \sectref{subsec:5-2-1}) is to some extent carried over to and partly overlapping with certain sets of adverbial pro"=forms. 



Although the symmetry is not complete, the relevant forms are given in \tabref{tab:7-1}, to be easily identified when referred to in the sections to follow.



For the spatial adverbs (also referred to as adverbial demonstratives or locational deictics, \citealt[431]{diessel2006}), all four categories are represented, and as with the pronouns, there are in most cases two forms available in each category: a~neutral (or highly accessible) form, and an~emphasised form (used for referring back to something less accessible in the discourse, or correlatively, see \sectref{sec:13-6}), the latter with an~initial \textit{ee-}. As not to clutter the table more than necessary, only the emphasised forms are included (e.g. emphasised \textit{eetáa} corresponds to neutral \textit{táa}). Neither are the B. forms included in the table (there is a~regular correspondence between A. \textit{ee-} and B. \textit{ha-}; A. \textit{ɡóo}~-- B. \textit{ɡúu}; ablative forms A. \textit{-áai}~-- and B. \textit{-áauu}.)



Used adverbially, the oblique forms (also functioning as \textsc{3sg} ergative pronouns) are always used
along with a~positional or directional postposition (hence the hyphen), see \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}, the only
exception being the indefinite"=interrogative \textit{kíi}, which can be used alone meaning
`where to'. The locative and ablative can also be followed by a~directional postposition, but can
also stand alone as spatial adverbs. As will be further discussed and exemplified in \sectref{sec:7-2}, the
members of the spatial set may also take on a~temporal interpretation along with certain
postpositions.

\label{tab:7-1}
\end{table}

The degree adverbs are primarily modifiers of adjectives, whereas the manner adverbs modify entire clauses. The form \textit{eendáa} with the Converb form of \textit{bhe-} `become' is used with intransitive clauses, while that with \textit{the-} `do' is used with transitive clauses. 

There is no obvious symmetrical correspondence to the indefinite"=interrogative temporal adverb \textit{kareé} `when', but the nearest functional equivalent is \textit{eetheél} `then, at that time'. 

\subsection{Spatial adverbs}
\label{subsec:7-1-2}

Most adverbial expressions with spatial semantics are either pronominal/deictic or nominal in nature or derived from those word classes, often playing a~syntactic role similar to that of noun phrases and postpositional phrases.

\subsubsection*{The deictic set \textit{índa~-- eeṛáa~-- eetáa~-- ɡóo} etc.}

As mentioned above, most of these adverbial deictics are related to demonstratives, and some may be
used pronominally as well as adverbially. Typically they describe location, meaning
\textit{índa} `here', \textit{eeṛáa} `there (further away but still visible),
\textit{eetáa} `there' (not visible), \textit{ɡóo} `where', the latter primarily
interrogatively. It may, beside its primary static reading, as in (\ref{ex:7-1}), also imply goal, as in
(\ref{ex:7-2}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-1}
\gll áaḍ-a [índa] bhíl-a áaḍ-a ba naaṛéy-a  the ɡíia \\
half-\textsc{mpl} here become.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} half-\textsc{mpl} \textsc{prt} Narey-\textsc{ob}  to  go.\textsc{pfv.pl}  \\
\glt `Some remained here, while others went to Narey.' (A:ANC005)

\ex
\label{ex:7-2}
\gll [táa] yhaí ba ɡóo hín-u bhraapútr  thaníit-u \\
there come.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} where be.\textsc{prs"=msg} nephew  say.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `When he came there, he said: ``Where is he, nephew?''' (A:PAS058)
\end{exe}
The members of the series \textit{andóoii~-- eeṛáai~-- eetáai~-- ɡóoii} have an~ablative function,
expressing a~movement away from a~location, as in example (\ref{ex:7-3}), or an~origin in a~certain
location.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-3}
\gll [eetáai] wheel-í ɡhróom-a phedóol-u \\
from.there take.down-\textsc{cv} village-\textsc{ob} bring.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Taking it [the corpse] down from there, we got it to the village.' (A:GHA075)
\end{exe}
The members of the locative series as well as of the ablative may be further specified (for goal or
source) or emphasised by a~following postposition, and for some postpositions, such as \textit{wée}
in (\ref{ex:7-4}), the members of the oblique series have to be used instead of those of the
locative or ablative series (for further examples, see \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-4}
\gll ṣiṣ ba [aníi-wee] bi buṭí [aníi-wee]  bi buṭí \\
head \textsc{prt} \textsc{3sg.prox.ob-}in also plait-\textsc{cv} \textsc{3sg.prox.ob-}in also plait-\textsc{cv} \\
\glt `As for his head, here and here he had braided [his hair].' (A:JAN069)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection*{Various spatial adverbs}

\spitzmarke{\textit{huṇḍ} `up'.} This essentially nominal adverb is used for a~location situated in a~more or less vertical upward direction (not necessarily visible) from the point of reference. Used alone it can refer to a~location `up (there)', as in (\ref{ex:7-5}), as well as a~movement to such a~location.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-5}
\gll [huṇḍ] ta c̣hiítr"=ee [bhun] ba ɡhaawaáz de  \\
above \textsc{prt} field-\textsc{cnj} below \textsc{prt} stream.bed be.\textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The field was up above and the stream"=bed down below.' (A:JAN082)
\end{exe}
From \textit{huṇḍ} a~number of other semantically related adverbs or adverbial phrases can be derived: \textit{huṇḍ the/húṇṭe} `up (to)', as in (\ref{ex:7-6}); \textit{huṇḍíi/huṇḍíi thíi} `from above'; \textit{huṇḍɡiraá} (A.), example (\ref{ex:7-7}); or \textbf{huṇṭeɡiráak/huṇṭráak} (B.) `upward, uphill', \textit{huṇḍaṛáa} ({\textless} \textit{huṇḍ + eeṛáa}) `up there'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-6}
\gll sum [huṇḍ the] ṣuɡal-í ba čo ba  thaníit-u \\
soil up to throw-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} go go.\textsc{imp.sg} say.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `He threw soil up [in the air] and said: ``Go on!''' (A:PIR037)

\ex
\label{ex:7-7}
\gll [huṇḍɡiraá] dac̣h-íin ta iṇc̣ muṭ-íi phúṭi ǰhulí bheš-í áaṇc̣-a khiáan-u \\
upward  look-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{prt} bear tree-\textsc{gn} top on sit-\textsc{cv} raspberry-\textsc{pl} eat.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `They were looking up and saw the bear sitting in the top of the tree eating rasberries.' (A:KAT145)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{bhun} `down'.} This essentially nominal adverb is used for a~location situated downward or below the point of reference. Used alone it can refer to a~location `down (there)' (see (\ref{ex:7-5})) as well as a~movement to such a~location, as in (\ref{ex:7-8}).


The following adverbs or adverbial phrases are examples of derivations from \textit{bhun}: \textit{bhún the/bhuná} `down (to)', \textit{bhuníi thíi} `from below', \textit{bhunɡiraá} (A.) or \textbf{bhunteɡiráak/bhuntráak} (B.) `downward', \textit{bhunimaá} `(on the way) downhill', exemplified in (\ref{ex:7-9}), \textit{bhunaṛáa} (and other deictic forms based on it) `down there'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-8}
\gll so méeš hatí maǰí-e uṭik-í [bhun]  whayí ba uḍheew-í wháat-u\\
\textsc{dem.msg.nom} man \textsc{3sg.rem.ob} in-\textsc{cnj} jump.\textsc{cv} down
come.down.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} flee-\textsc{cv} come.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Meanwhile, the man jumped down [from the tree] and fled down [to the village].' (B:CLE377)

\ex
\label{ex:7-9}
\gll tuúš [bhunimaá] wh-íi ta karáaṛu  ukh-áand-u \\
some downhill  come.down-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{prt} leopard come.up-\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `Getting some ways downhill, [he meets] the leopard coming up.' (A:KAT095)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{aǰá} (B. \textit{aǰé}) `up (there)'.} This essentially deictic adverb is used for a~location situated upstream or in a~slightly upward location from the point of reference (cf. \textit{huṇḍ} which implies a~place more or less straight above the point of reference). Used alone it can refer to a~location `up/over (there), upstream' as well as a~movement to such a~location, as in (\ref{ex:7-10}). Although not quite as productive as \textit{huṇḍ} and \textit{bhun}, this adverb is similarly used as a~building block for other adverbs and adverbial expressions, such as \textit{aǰimaá} `upward', \textit{aǰaṛáa} `up/over there', \textit{aǰí/aǰí thíi} (B.) `from upstreams/up"=country'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-10}
\gll yáab ɡhaš-í [aǰá] ɡúum ta  \\
canal take-\textsc{cv} up go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \textsc{prt} \\
\glt `I went up along the irrigation canal.' (A:HUA053)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{túuri} `down (there)'.} This adverb, otherwise mostly used as a~postposition (see \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}), is only occasionally used without a~noun or pronoun as an~argument. It seems to be contrasting with the aforementioned adverb in describing a~location or movement downstream from the point of reference, such as in (\ref{ex:7-11}). It may also be followed by the postposition \textit{wée} (see \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-11}
\gll dúi xálak ba [túuri] drhúuk-a the ɡéa  \\
other people \textsc{prt} down gorge-\textsc{ob}  to go.\textsc{pfv.pl} \\
\glt `The other people went down to the valley.' (B:AVA205)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{rhalá} `up (above, on top)'.} This adverbial expression, related to the adjective \textit{ráal} (primarily occurring as as a~host element in conjunct verbs with meanings such as `raise, lift up'), is used for describing the position on top of a~structure or object, as in example (\ref{ex:7-12}). In some sentences its function may rather be analysed as that of a~manner adverb or a~postposition.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-12}
\gll dúi hiimaál whayí ṭópa traác̣ de asaám  [rhalá] ɡaḍíl-a \\
other glacier come.down.\textsc{cv} down \textsc{idph} give.\textsc{cv} \textsc{1pl.acc} up take.out.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} \\
\glt `Another avalanche struck, pushing from below, and brought us up [on top of the snow].' (A:ACR015)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{awaaɡír} `up high, at a~high elevation'.} This adverbial expression (possibly also adjectival) seems to be exclusively used for referring to a~high elevation in the mountains.


\spitzmarke{\textit{phará} `yonder, over there'.} This deictic adverb (probably based on a~spatial
noun *\textit{phaár} or *\textit{paár}, cf. \textit{aḍaphaár} `halfways' below) is used
for a~location some distance away but still visible (and in a~straight line) from the point of
reference, as in (\ref{ex:7-13}), often in contrast with \textit{oóra} `on this side, over here'
(see below). Like some of the other spatial adverbs above, it is used as a~building block for other
adverbs and adverbial expressions: such as \textit{pharimaá} (A.)/\textit{pehrimaá} (B.)
`(some ways) forward, onward', \textit{pharaṛáa} `over there, yonder', \textit{pharíi
  thíi} (A.)/\textit{parí thíi} (B.) `from some distance away', \textit{pharaɡiraá}
`at some distance'. The deictic expression \textit{pharaṛáa} may be further modified by vowel
lengthening: \textit{phaaraṛáa}, implying a~location even further away than
\textit{pharaṛáa}. (Cf. also the postposition \textit{pharé}, \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-13}
\gll so šái bi tanaám sanɡí yhaí [oóra] šan-á, ma ba [phará] khilayí dharíit-u \\
\textsc{dem.msg.nom} thing also \textsc{3pl.acc} with come.\textsc{cv} over.here roof-\textsc{ob} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{prt} yonder alone remain.\textsc{pfv"=msg}\\
\glt `That thing also came with them to the roof over here, but I remained alone over there.' (A:HUA032-3)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{oóra} `on this side, over here'.} As already mentioned and exemplified in (\ref{ex:7-13}), this deictic adverb is used in contrast with \textbf{\textit{phará}}, implying a~location close to the point of reference as opposed to a~location further away. I am not aware of any derivations from this adverb. 

\spitzmarke{\textit{patú} `behind, in back'.} This basic form is, according to my material, only used as a~postpostion (in A.) or conjunction (in B.), see \sectref{subsec:7-2-2}; however, a~couple of (partly spatial, partly temporal) adverbial expressions are clearly derived from it: \textit{patuɡiraá} (exemplified in (\ref{ex:7-14}))\textit{/patuɡiróo/paturaá} (A.)/\textit{patuɡiráak} (B.) `back', \textit{padúši ({\textless} patú+dúši)} `behind', as in (\ref{ex:7-15}), the latter almost exclusively used in a~temporal sense in B. (cf. \sectref{subsec:7-1-3}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-14}
\gll se páand [patuɡiraá] na lháay-a de  \\
\textsc{3pl.nom} path back  \textsc{neg} find-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst}\\
\glt `It did not find its way back.' (A:CAV020)

\ex
\label{ex:7-15}
\gll bakáara ta muṣṭú bhe whéet-i-ee  be ba [padúši] wh-áand-a \\
flock \textsc{prt} in.front become.\textsc{cv} come.down.\textsc{pfv-f-cnj} \textsc{1pl.nom} \textsc{prt} behind come.down-\textsc{prs"=mpl}\\
\glt `The flock got down before us, and then we came down behind.' (A:PAS052)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{muṣṭú} (A. only) `in front, ahead, forward'.} As with the aforementioned adverbial group, \textit{muṣṭú} has in addition to its basic spatial meaning, as in (\ref{ex:7-16}), acquired some largely temporal aspects (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-3}). A nearly synonymous \textit{muṣṭuɡiraá} is also derived from it. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-16}
\gll tuúš [muṣṭú] bíi ta áak luumái ḍhoó dít-i hín-i \\
some in.front go.\textsc{3sg} \textsc{prt} \textsc{idef} fox sight give.\textsc{pfv-f} be.\textsc{prs-f}\\
\glt `Going some distance forward, he saw a~fox.' (A:KAT011)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{nhiáaṛa} (B. \textit{niháaṛa}) `near, nearby'.} This adverb is often used in a~so"=called compound postposition (\sectref{subsec:7-2-3}) but may also be used alone (\ref{ex:7-17}) as a~spatial adverb.
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-17}
\gll tasíi ba páanǰ ṣo bhraawú [nhiáaṛa] hóons"=an de \\
\textsc{3sg.gn} \textsc{prt} five six brother.\textsc{pl} near stay-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst}\\
\glt `Five or six of her brothers were living nearby.' (A:HUA119)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{dhúura} `far away'.} Like the aforementioned adverb, it is often used in a~compound postposition (\sectref{subsec:7-2-3}), but may also be used independently.

\spitzmarke{\textit{šíiṭi} `inside'.} This adverb, also used as a~simple postposition
(\sectref{subsec:7-2-2}), as well as in postpositional sequences (\sectref{subsec:7-2-4}), may be derived diachronically from
a~noun formerly denoting `house' or `home'\footnote{For `house' as well as `home',
  \textit{ɡhoóṣṭ} is used in today's Palula.} and a~postposition `to' (cf. Kalkoti
\textit{šíi} `house', \textit{šíiti} `inside, into the house'), or it may have been borrowed
as a~whole or partly from a~variety of Kohistani (cf. Kalam Kohistani \textit{šiṭ} `house, home',
\textit{šiṭši} `inside', \textit{ši} `in, into', \citealt[119]{baart1997}; \citeyear[76]{baart1999a}). It is mostly used
dynamically, as in example (\ref{ex:7-18}), as a~spatial adverb.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-18}
\gll ma šíiṭi be tes sanɡí madád th-áam \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} inside go.\textsc{cv} \textsc{3sg.acc} with help do-\textsc{1sg}\\
\glt `I will go inside and help him.' (B:FOY)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{aḍaphaár} `halfways'.} Composed of \textit{*aḍa {\textgreater} áaḍa} `half' and \textit{*phaar} (see above) `yonder', it is used in this essentially nominal form for the movement up to a~point somewhere right between the point of origin and an~expected goal, but it may occur in an~oblique form \textit{aḍaphará} with no obvious difference in meaning, a~form to which the postposition \textit{tií} (\sectref{subsec:7-2-2}) can be added, rendering the approximate meaning `as far as halfways'. It can also occur in the genitive \textit{aḍapharíi} `from the middle', as seen in example (\ref{ex:7-19}). 
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-19}
\gll [aḍapharíi] huṇḍ the ta ǰaláṣ bhun the  ba lhíst-u \\
from.middle up to \textsc{prt} hairy down  to \textsc{prt} bald-\textsc{msg}\\
\glt `From the middle and up it was hairy, whereas it was bald below.' (A:HUA075)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Temporal adverbs}
\label{subsec:7-1-3}

Like spatial adverbs, many adverbial expressions with temporal semantics are nominal in nature, but there are also a~number of synchronically non"=derived temporal adverbs.

\subsubsection*{General deictic adverbs}

\spitzmarke{\textit{típa} `now'.} This freqently used and synchronically non"=derived adverb is
used for referring to the present moment, as illustrated in (\ref{ex:7-20}), as well as to
`nowadays' in general. There is also a~rather little used form \textit{tipaán tií} `until
now, even to this day'. Interestingly `from now, after this' is expressed with the proximate
ablative member of the spatial set, \textit{andóoii pahúrta}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-20}
\gll [típa] ba ma tasíi paalaweeṇíi qiseé tháan-u \\
now \textsc{prt} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{3sg.gn} strongmanship.\textsc{gn} story.\textsc{pl} do.\textsc{prs"=msg}\\
\glt `Now I am telling the stories about his strongmanship.' (A:PAS029)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{muṣṭú} (A.)/\textit{muxáak} (B.) `before, in the past, once'.} The A. adverb has spatial functions (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-2}) along with its temporal ones. Both the A. and the B. adverb may take additional modifiers, such as degree adverbs (\textit{bíiḍu muṣṭú} `long before, a~long time ago') or calendrical expressions (\textit{dúu yúuna muxáak} `two months ago'). The meaning `since then, for a~long time' can be expressed by \textit{muṣṭúi niiɡiraá}. A sentence with the B. adverb \textit{muxáak} is given in (\ref{ex:7-21}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-21}
\gll [muxáak] be iskuul-í the b-íia de \\
before  \textsc{1pl.nom} school-\textsc{ob} to go-\textsc{1pl} \textsc{pst}\\
\glt `Once, when we were going to school...' (B:ANG001)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{eetheél/(eesé) waxtíi} `at that time, in those days, then'.} Usually, for reference to a~specific time (usually in the past), as in (\ref{ex:7-22}), the genitive of the noun \textit{waxt} (or \textit{waqt}) `time' is used with a~preceding demonstrative (if referred to contextually) or another identifying modifier (\textit{kufurdóore waxtíe} `in the pagan era' B.), but also the synchronically non"=derived adverb \textit{eetheél}, possibly more widely used in the past, is still in use, as can be seen in example (\ref{ex:7-23}). The latter can refer to a~point of time in the past as well as in the future (e.g. in \textit{eetheél tií} `before that time, up to that time').

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-22}
\gll neečíir ba eesé [waxt-íi] bíiḍ-i \\
hunting \textsc{prt} \textsc{rem.ob} time-\textsc{gn}  much-\textsc{f } \\
\glt `As for hunting, there was a~lot of it in those days.' (A:HUA046)

\ex
\label{ex:7-23}
\gll [eetheél] maidaaní ǰanɡ de \\
that.time  of.field  war be.\textsc{pst } \\
\glt `In those days there used to be fighting in the fields.' (A:PIR005)
\end{exe}

The genitive of the English loan \textit{ṭeém} `time' is used in a~way quite similar to \textit{waxtíi}, taking various modifiers, such as \textit{basandíi ṭeemíi} `at spring time'.


\spitzmarke{\textit{aakatí waxtí (maǰí)/waxt bhe/padúši} (B.) `later, after some time'.} A number of expressions, some of them containing forms of the noun \textit{waxt}, are used when referring to a~later point in time, in (\ref{ex:7-24}) with the Converb of \textit{bhe-} `become' (cf. manner adverbs formed with Converbs, \sectref{subsec:7-1-4}). Only in the B. variety is \textit{padúši} used in a~clearly temporal sense (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-2}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-24}
\gll khéli [waxt bhe] dac̣h-íi ta \\
quite.some time become.\textsc{cv} look-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{prt}\\
\glt `Some time later he was looking.' (A:SMO016) 
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{waxtíi thíi} `early'.} Again, the noun \textit{waxt} is used, now in the genitive and with the directional postposition \textit{thíi}. Also the adverb \textit{raɣáṣṭi} has been noted in B.


\spitzmarke{\textit{kareé} `when, what time'.} This is a~member of the series of
indefinite"=interrogative pronouns and other pro"=forms (see \sectref{subsec:13-4-1} and
\sectref{subsec:14-2-2}).


Adjectival derivations with \textit{-úk-} are also used in expressing similar temporal"=deictic propositions, e.g. \textit{tipúku} `of now, ``nowish''', \textit{muṣṭúku} `of the past, of old, ``oldish''', as seen in (\ref{ex:7-24}), \textit{eetheelúku} `of that time' (see \tabref{tab:7-2} on p.~\pageref{tab:7-2}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-25}
\gll [muṣṭúk-a xálak-a] dhii-á díi na khooǰ-óon de \\
of.past-\textsc{mpl} people-\textsc{pl}  daughter-\textsc{ob} from \textsc{neg} ask-\textsc{3pl} \textsc{pst}  \\
\glt `People in the old days were not asking their daughter [who she wanted to marry].' (A:MAR018)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection*{Calendrical adverbs}

The most common calendrical adverbs used deictically are synchronically non"=derived:


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q }
\textit{áaǰ} &
`today' &
\textit{heeṇṣúka} &
`this year'\\
\textit{dhoóṛ} &
`yesterday' &
\textit{páar (B.} \textit{par)} &
`last year'\\
\textit{eetríli} &
`the day before yesterday' &
\textit{triimbarúṣ (B.} \textit{trimbaríṣ)} &
`two years ago'\\
\textit{trúnǰi (B.)} &
`the day after tomorrow' &
\textit{bhióol} &
`last night'\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


In (\ref{ex:7-26}), the use of \textit{dhoóṛṛṛ} `yesterday' is illustrated.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-26}
\gll [dhoóṛ] índa kir dít-u de típa  bi kir hín-u \\
yesterday  here snow give.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{pst} now  also snow be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `It was snowing here yesterday, and even now there is snow.' (A:CHE070320)
\end{exe}

These adverbs also behave morphologically more like spatial deictic adverbs than nouns, when expressing notions such as `before, until' or `from, since'. While the basic form is used with postpositions otherwise taking oblique arguments, an~inflection \textit{-ii} or an~idiosyncratic \textit{-oo} (cf. B. \textit{hatáwuu} `from there' and related forms) with an~ablative function is used with \textit{pahúrta} and \textit{niiɡiraá}:


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q P{30mm} Q }

\textit{áaǰ tií} &
`until today' &
\textit{áaǰii niiɡiraá, áaǰii pahúrta} &
`from today, after today'\\
\textit{dhoóṛ tií} &
`until yesterday' &
\textit{dhoóṛoo niiɡiraá} &
`since yesterday'\\
\textit{eetríli tií} &
`until the day before yesterday' &
\textit{eetríloo niiɡiraá} &
`since the day before yesterday'\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


Although \textit{heeṇṣúka} `this year' diachronically may be an~adjectivally derived form (with \textit{-úk-}), it is used like the other non"=derived deictic adverbs, as in (\ref{ex:7-27}), without modifying a~noun head. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-27}
\gll [heeṇṣúka] ma čiiríit-u \\
this.year  \textsc{1sg.nom}  be.delayed.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `This year I'm delayed.' (A:SHY026)
\end{exe}

Belonging semantically to this group is also \textit{rhootašíia} (also with the forms \textit{rhoošíia} and \textit{rhoošée}) `tomorrow', used as in (\ref{ex:7-28}), which, however, is the oblique case of the noun \textit{rhootašíi} `morning'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-28}
\gll ma nis áaǰ kh-úum ta [rhootašíi-a] ba  kanáa bh-úum \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{3sg.acc} today eat-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{prt} morning-\textsc{ob} \textsc{prt} like.what become-\textsc{1sg} \\
\glt `If I eat this today, what will then become of me tomorrow.' (A:HUB005)
\end{exe}

As with the general deictic adverbs, adjectival forms in \textit{-úk-} can be productively derived from most, if not all, of these calendrical adverbs: \textit{aaǰúku} `of today', today's', \textbf{bhiaalúku} `of/from last night', \textit{parúku} `of/from last year, last year's', etc. 


The identity of most calendrical cyclic expressions (\tabref{tab:7-2}), on the other hand, is clearly nominal, although the oblique case forms can be said to have been lexicalised as adverbs. 


\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Calendrical cyclic adverbs}

\end{tabularx}
\label{tab:7-2}
\end{table}


In (\ref{ex:7-29}), the use of \textit{heewandá, róota} and \textit{deesá} can be seen.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-29}
\gll [heewand-á] tas the [róot-a] c̣hóoṇ  lamayáan-a [dees-á] har-í wíi

\glt `In the winter we hang oak"=branches for her [the goat] during the night, and in the day we take her to drink plenty of water in beautiful places.' (A:KEE091)
\end{exe}

While the above oblique forms of the calendrical nouns express a ``temporal location'', a~couple of these and a~number of other temporal nouns (such as \textit{kaál} `year', \textit{yúun} `month', \textit{haftá} `week') may be used in various forms and derivations to express temporal quantities or frequences. The examples (\ref{ex:7-30})--(\ref{ex:7-39}) all constitute adverbial phrases in Palula.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-30}

\ex
\label{ex:7-39}
\gll dúi kaal-á the \\
other year-\textsc{ob} to \\
\glt `another year, next year'
\end{exe}

Most time"=of"=day expressions are nouns, quite a~few of them loans from Pashto. They are like the
calendrical cyclic ones above in that they occur in their oblique case form when functioning as
time"=of"=day adverbs. Two exceptions are \textit{rhoošnaám} `morning' (in (\ref{ex:7-40})) and
\textit{dhrumanaám} `mid"=afternoon', which are synchronically non"=derived adverbs.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-40}
\gll [dhrumanaám] ba pašambeé ta c̣hóoṇ-ii bháaru ɡhin-í ma ba ɡúči \\

\glt `In the afternoon Pashambi carried fodder [to the goats] while I was free.' (A:PAS051)
\end{exe}

\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{Manner adverbs}
\label{subsec:7-1-4}

Manner is mainly expressed by nonfinite verb forms, primarily the Converb and the Copredicative Participle. The former of those is the basis for what can be considered a~derivation of manner adverbs (or its nearest equivalent) from other parts of speech, particularly from adjectives. 

\subsubsection*{Non"=derived manner adverbs}

There is a~small class of non"=derived manner adverbs (the list is not meant to be exhaustive): 


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q }

\textit{bhraáš} &
`slowly' &
\textit{lap} &
`quickly, fast'\\
\textit{táru} &
`quickly, soon' &
\textit{khilayí} &
`alone'\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-41}
\gll ǰanɡibaazxaan-á [bhraáš] šukhaáu ɡaḍ-í čhúuṇ-u \\
Jangibaz.Khan-\textsc{ob} slowly coat take.off-\textsc{cv} put.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `Slowly, Jangibaz Khan took off his coat.' (A:JAN066)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection*{The deictic set \textit{eendáa-bhe~-- kanáa-bhe~-- eendáa-the~--
    kanáa-the}\authcomm{Please check the hierarchical rank of this heading.}}

This series exemplifies the derivation of manner adverbs. Here a~deictic manner adverb (or adverb
phrase) is formed by adding the Converb form of a~verbaliser (\textit{the-} `do' or \textit{bhe-}
`become') to the deictic adjective\footnote{This can also be analysed as a~pro"=form of the host
  element in a~conjunct verb (which does not necessarily need to be an~adjective) or a~predicate
  phrase (whether nominal or adjectival).} \textit{eendáa} (B. \textit{handáa} or the alternative
non"=emphatic form \textit{andáa}). For modifying an~intransitive predicate, as in (\ref{ex:7-42}),
\textit{bhe} is used, for modifying a~transitive predicate, as in (\ref{ex:7-43}), \textit{the} is
used, and for questioning the manner by which something is done, the indefinite"=interrogative
\textit{kanáa} and the relevant Converb is used (see \sectref{subsec:14-2-2}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-42}
\gll [andáa-bhe] praš-í wée baṭ-á wh-áand-a \\
like.that"=become.\textsc{cv} slope-\textsc{ob} in stone-\textsc{pl} come.down-\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `Just like that, stones came down the slope.' (A:AYB008)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-43}
\gll dharéndi mhaálu dac̣h-áaṭ-u bhíl-u hín-u  siɡréṭ dhrak-í ba
     [andáa-the] \\
outside father look-\textsc{ag"=msg} become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} be.\textsc{prs"=msg} cigarette pull-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} like.that"=do.\textsc{cv}  \\
\glt `While looking at his father outside, he was smoking the cigarette like that.' (A:SMO009)
\end{exe}

The clue to the interpretation of the deictic manner adverb is usually found in the immediate context of the utterance, either explicitly in the wider discourse, sometimes rendering `thus' a~good translation equivalent, or by extralinguistic means, such as gestures by the speaker. 


\subsubsection*{Derivation of manner adverbs}

The derivational process described above is quite productively applied to words from various parts
of speech (primarily adjectives and pronouns) in forming manner adverbial expressions, as
illustrated in \tabref{tab:7-3}. To what extent these derivations are adverbs, adverbial phrases or
adverbial (mini-)clauses is still open to further analysis, but considering their embedded status
and the fact that they form a~phonological word, we tentatively define them as derived
adverbs. Neither is the relationship between Converb clauses with conjunct verbs and these manner
adverbials entirely clearcut. An exact parallel to this formation is described by
\citet[219]{schmidtkohistani2008} for Kohistani Shina.


\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Examples of manner adverbial derivation}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ P{17mm} l l Q Q }
\lsptoprule
Adjective, etc. &
&
&

\\\hline
\textit{šúi} &

\textit{šúi-the, šúi-bhe} &
`well'\\
\textit{šišáwi} &
`beautiful' &

\textit{šišáwi"=the, šišáwi"=bhe} &
`completely'\\
\textit{teéz} &

`hard, with force'\\
\textit{tíiṇu} &

`carefully, intently'\\
\textit{buṭheé} &

\textit{buṭheé-bhe, bhuṭeé-the} &
`all of them, together'\\\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\label{tab:7-3}
\end{table}


Also ideophonic expressions (without any specific or standardised lexical source), such as those in (\ref{ex:7-44}), can be made manner adverbs this way. (The adverbs in the English translation in (\ref{ex:7-44}) are only approximate equivalents of the Converb cum reduplicated ideophone complexes.\footnote{A widespread covariation of so"=called periphrastic `do'-constructions and reduplicated stems has been noted by \citet{jaeger2006}.})

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-44}
\gll se insaan-á ráaǰ mučaá o muṭ-á sanɡí  so amzarái seéb
     [ram"=raám-the] [kaš-kaáš-the] ɡhaṇḍ-í ɡáil-u \\

\glt `The man opened a~rope and tied Lord Lion firmly and tightly to the tree.' (A:KIN023)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Degree adverbs}
\label{subsec:7-1-5}
The function of degree adverbs is mostly to modify adjectives, but some of them also function as modifiers of other adverbs as well as of nouns. 

\subsubsection*{Non"=derived degree adverbs}

Forming a~small class, non"=derived degree adverbs are mainly used as modifiers of other adverbs but also as quantifiers of nouns, especially non"=count nouns (this list is not meant to be exhaustive). See (\ref{ex:7-9}) for an~example with \textit{tuúš}: 


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l@{\hspace{30pt}} Q l@{\hspace{30pt}} Q }
\textit{tuúš} &
`some, little' &
\textit{khéli} &
`several, somewhat'\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{The deictic pair \textit{eetí} (B. \textit{hatí})~-- \textit{katí}\authcomm{Please
    check the hierarchical rank of this heading.}}

These deictic degree adverbs intensify adjectives, meaning `such, so', as in (\ref{ex:7-45})\textit{,} and `what, how', as in (\ref{ex:7-46}). (Note that \textit{katí} in particular also functions as a~direct quantifying modifier of a~noun head, meaning `how much, how many'.)

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-45}
\gll baṣ [hatí] teéz bhíl-u ooḍháal whéet-i \\
rain such strong become.\textsc{pfv"=msg} flood come.down.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `The rain became so strong that it flooded.' (B:FLO169)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-46}
\gll nu ba [katí] utháal-u táapaṛ \\
\textsc{3sg.prox.nom} \textsc{prt} how.much high-\textsc{msg}  hill  \\
\glt `What a~high hill!' (A:HLE3117)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection*{Reduplication}

Reduplication is one strategy applied for degree modification of manner adverbs. The process can be
full reduplication, as seen in (\ref{ex:7-47}), or reduplication of the first syllable. In example
(\ref{ex:7-48}) both full and first"=syllable reduplication are being used.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-47}
\gll wháat-a andáa bhe [bhraáš bhraáš] \\
come.down.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} like.that become.\textsc{cv} \textsc{red} slowly  \\
\glt `We came down like that, very slowly.' (A:GHA056)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-48}
\gll mhaamaǰaán ba [la-láp la-láp] khóo de \\
\textsc{3sg.prox.nom} \textsc{prt} \textsc{red}-fast \textsc{red}-fast eat.\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst } \\
\glt `Mahmad Jan was eating very fast.' (A:MAH044)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection*{Lexicalised intensifiers}

There is a~number of more or less standard compounds with an~adjective/adverb and a (mostly) unique
element, where the latter serves the purpose of intensification, not much different from the effect
other degree adverbs have on the modified constituent. It seems those elements are mostly made up of
a~single closed syllable:


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q l@{\hspace{20pt}} Q }

\textit{phaṣ paṇáaru} &
`white as a~sheet' &
\textit{tap c̣hiṇ} &
`pitch dark'\\
\textit{kham kiṣíṇu} &
`pitch black' &
\textit{bak práal} &
`shining bright'\\
\textit{čáu lhóilu} &
`bright red' &
\textit{ḍanɡ khilayí} &
`all alone'\\
\textit{tak zeṛ} &

\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\section{Postpositions}
\label{sec:7-2}

All regularly used adpositions in Palula are postpositions. Most of them have spatial"=temporal functions, but a~few express some grammatical as well as spatial"=temporal functions. Whenever a~full noun is followed by a~postposition it occurs in the oblique case (for those nouns that display a~distinct oblique case), except for a~couple of postpositions that take a~full noun genitive argument. When a~pronoun is followed by a~postposition, there is a~slightly higher degree of case differentiation (this will be commented on under each individual postposition presented) as compared to nouns followed by postpositions.


Apart from simple single word postpositions (\sectref{subsec:7-2-2}), there are two types of complex postpositions, compound postpositions (\sectref{subsec:7-2-3}) and postpositional sequences (\sectref{subsec:7-2-4}). Some of the postpositions also function as adverbs (see above) or as heads of adverb phrases. 


\subsection{Postpositions vis-à-vis case inflection}
\label{subsec:7-2-1}


Case inflection has been treated elsewhere (see \sectref{sec:4-5}), but since the differentiation between this category and adpositions (both following nouns) is not always obvious, particularly in IA languages, this should be commented on briefly. 


One line of argumentation is phonological, where a~string of segments with its own pitch accent would be considered a~separate word, thus a~postposition and not an~inflection. This would definitely place the longer strings, i.e. those with two or more syllables, in the postposition category. The shorter, monosyllabic ones, however, are phonologically weak, and tend to cliticise to the preceding noun word or pronoun. Another line of argument is morphological, by which case"=inflections occur close to the stem, whereas postpositions combine with already case"=inflected forms of the noun (and mostly by non"=nominative forms of pronouns), and thus are more peripheral. Using this argument, the genitive morpheme ends up as somewhat ambiguous in this respect (see \sectref{subsec:4-5-3}).


A third line of argumentation may be more helpful, a~mainly syntactic one, with the coordinating suffix or clitic \textit{-ee} as a~diagnostic tool (see \citealt[77]{baart1999a}, for his analysis on case marking in Kalam Kohistani). While inflectional suffixes obligatorily occur on both of two nouns coordinated with \textit{-ee}, a~postposition is attached once, to the coordination as a~whole, and does not occur inside the coordination. According to the latter diagnostics, the genitive along with the other case inflections (as described in \sectref{sec:4-5}) are clearly distinguished from the postpositions (as described below). 


Many of the postpositional functions described below, especially those of the more central simple postpositions, are expressed by what are clearly inflectional case"=suffixes rather than free postpositions in closely related Kohistani Shina \citep[115--130]{schmidtkohistani2001}. 


\subsection{Simple postpositions}
\label{subsec:7-2-2}

The order of the following presentation, without any claim of total comprehensiveness, reflects to a~great extent the relative centrality and frequency of simple postpositions in Palula, proceding from the more central/frequent to the more specialised or less frequent ones. 


The postpositions \textit{the} and \textit{díi} are very common and express a~number of grammatical as well as spatial"=temporal functions. 


\spitzmarke{\textit{the} `to, for'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument, `house' in (\ref{ex:7-50}), or an~accusative pronominal argument, `us' in (\ref{ex:7-49}). There is a~wide range of meanings, all having the core semantics of marking the recipient of a~transaction or the goal of a~movement. 
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-49}
\gll na ta tanaám the dít-i na ba  [asaám the] dít-i \\
\textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} \textsc{3pl.acc} to give.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{neg} \textsc{prt} \textsc{1pl.acc} to give.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `Neither did they give them [the guns] to them, nor to us.' (A:GHA089)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-50}
\gll ma bhíiru ɡhin-í thíi [ɡhooṣṭ-á the] yhúum \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} he.goat take-\textsc{cv} \textsc{2sg.gn} house-\textsc{ob} to come.\textsc{1sg} \\
\glt `I'll take a~goat with me and come to your house.' (A:MIT013)
\end{exe}

Apart from marking the recipient in a~typical ``ditransitive'' clause, \textit{the} can also identify a~beneficiary in a~transitive clause and the recipient of an~abstract entity, such as the utterance in (\ref{ex:7-51}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-51}
\gll dhii-á [mac̣ook-á the] maníit-u... \\
daughter-\textsc{ob} Machoke-\textsc{ob} to say.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `The daughter told Machoke...' (A:MAA016)
\end{exe}

If \textit{the} marks a~goal expressed as a~spatial pro"=adverb (also functioning as an~inanimate/abstract demonstrative pronoun), the locative member of the set, \textit{táa} `there', in (\ref{ex:7-52}), is used.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-52}
\gll [táa the] misrí bulaḍ-eeṇḍeéu \\
there to mason call.for-\textsc{oblg}\\
\glt `A mason is called to there [or: to see to that].' (A:KAT009)
\end{exe}

However, if the goal of a~movement carried out by a~person is another person, the postpositions \textit{khúna} or \textit{kéeči} (see below) have to be used instead.


Verbal Nouns in complements of permissive predicates as well as Verbal Nouns in purpose clauses are also taken as arguments by \textit{the} (see \sectref{subsec:13-5-3} and \sectref{subsec:13-4-2}). Some arguments with \textit{the} are part of the valence pattern of some predicates, particularly non"=nominative experiencers (\sectref{subsec:12-2-6}) and objects of some conjunct verbs (\sectref{subsec:12-2-8}). 


It is also used in some temporal expressions (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-3}) as well as in specifying the direction of spatial adverbs (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-2}). Also, see (\sectref{subsec:7-2-4}), for the use of \textit{the} in postpositional sequences. 


\spitzmarke{\textit{díi} `from, (out) of, than'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument, `the Damelis' in (\ref{ex:7-53}), or an~accusative pronominal argument. There is a~wide range of meanings, all referring to the source of a~transaction or the point of origin/reference.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-53}
\gll ṛaním eeṛé riwaayát /{\ldots}/ [ɡiḍúuč-am díi]  ɡhíin-i hín-i \\
\textsc{3pl.dist.erg} \textsc{dist} tradition {} Dameli-\textsc{ob.pl} from take.\textsc{pfv-f} be.\textsc{prs-f}\\
\glt `They have received [lit. taken] this tradition from the Damelis.' (A:MIT002-5)
\end{exe}

Whereas a~place as the source or starting point for a~movement is almost always expressed with the genitive (along with the postposition \textit{thíi}), \textit{díi} is primarily postposed to nouns denoting human sources, such as `my grandmother' and `my father' in (\ref{ex:7-54}). The transferred, or brought forth, entity, however, can be abstract, such as an~utterance, as well as concrete, for instance in expressing the animate source of reproduction, as in (\ref{ex:7-55}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-54}
\gll [míi déedi díi] míi ṣúunt-u [míi  baába díi] míi
ṣúunt-u \\
\textsc{1sg.gn} grandmother from \textsc{1sg.gn} hear.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{1sg.gn} father.\textsc{ob} from \textsc{1sg.gn} hear.\textsc{pfv"=msg}\\
\glt `I heard it from my grandmother, and I heard it from my father.' (A:PAS005)

\ex
\label{ex:7-55}
\gll [khar-á díi] khar ǰa-yáan-u \\
donkey-\textsc{ob} from donkey be.born\textsf{-}\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `A donkey is born by a~donkey.' (B:PRB006)
\end{exe}

Some arguments with \textit{díi} are part of the valence pattern of some complex predicates (\sectref{subsec:12-2-8}), and Verbal Nouns in complements of negative implicative predicates are also taken as arguments by \textit{díi} (\sectref{subsec:13-5-2}).


The possessor in one main (primarily alienable, as the `mason's hammer' in (\ref{ex:7-56})) possessional construction is marked with \textit{díi}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-56}
\gll misrí yhóol-u sée$\sim$ta [misrí díi] tsaṭák hóons-a \\
mason come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} when mason from hammer stay-\textsc{3sg} \\
\glt `When the mason comes he will have a~hammer.' [lit. `When the mason has come, from the mason a~hammer will be present.'] (A:HOW010)
\end{exe}

Inalienable possession, on the other hand, is often expressed with the genitive case (a distribution parallel to that in Kohistani Shina, where the genitive case similarly is used for inalienable possession while the addessive case \textit{-di} or \textit{-idi} is used for alienable possession, \citealt[65, 69--70]{schmidtkohistani2008}).



The postposition \textit{díi} is also used to express the comparative degree of the standard of comparison (\sectref{subsec:6-3-3}).



\spitzmarke{\textit{sanɡí} `(along) with, at'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument or an~accusative pronominal argument. It typically expresses accompaniment, as in (\ref{ex:7-57}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-57}
\gll ḍaaku"=aan-óom yhayí [bakáara-m sanɡí] tas ɡhaš-í híṛ-u de \\
robber-\textsc{pl"=ob} come.\textsc{cv} flock-\textsc{ob}  with \textsc{3sg.acc} take-\textsc{cv} take.away.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The robbers came and abducted him along with his flock.' (A:GHA005)
\end{exe}

Used with an~inanimate noun, such as the `tree' in (\ref{ex:7-58}), it can have a~further connotation of being attached to.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-58}
\gll ma tu raáǰ-a de ɡhaṇḍ-í ɡal-áan-u [aní muṭ-á sanɡí] \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{2sg.nom} rope give.\textsc{cv} tie-\textsc{cv} throw-\textsc{prs"=msg} \textsc{prox} tree-\textsc{ob} with \\
\glt `I will tie you with ropes to this tree.' (A:KIN021)
\end{exe}

Some arguments with \textit{sanɡí} are part of the valence pattern of some intransitive verbs with a~postpositional object (\sectref{subsec:12-2-4}) as well as that of some complex predicates (\sectref{subsec:12-2-8}), typically those coding events or actions involving two participants on some sort of equal basis.


The postposition \textit{sanɡí} may also take as an~argument a~Verbal Noun in a~simultaneity clause (\sectref{subsec:13-4-1}).


\spitzmarke{\textit{ǰhulí} `on (top of), on to, over, about, due to'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument or (in most cases) an~accusative pronominal argument in its essentially spatial sense `on, onto' and an~oblique pronominal argument in more abstract senses such as `about, concerning'. It typically expresses a~position on the immediate surface of something, such as the `stone' in (\ref{ex:7-59}), or somebody.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-59}
\gll [se baṭ-á ǰhulí] se kuṇaak-íi paaṇṭí bi heensíl-i de \\
\textsc{def} stone-\textsc{ob} on \textsc{def}  child-\textsc{gn}  clothes also  stay.\textsc{pfv-f} \textsc{pst } \\
\glt `On the stone were also the child's clothes.' (A:BER012)
\end{exe}

It is also used for the movement onto the surface or into the position on top of something or somebody.


A pronoun referring to an~inanimate but still concrete entity can also (optionally it seems) occur in the oblique form with this postposition, the case otherwise used in pronominal reference to abstract entities (as in example (\ref{ex:7-60})). Note that the oblique pronoun (which is the same as the \textsc{3sg} agent in ergative alignment) here in fact is referring to the plural entity \textit{muṣṭookhurá} `forelegs'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-60}
\gll muṣṭookhur-á dhraǰaá ba [tíi ǰhulí] ṣiṣ čhoor-í ba bhéṭ-u \\
foreleg-\textsc{pl} stretch.out.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \textsc{3sg.ob} on head put-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} sit.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Stretching out its forelegs, it put its head on them/there and sat down.' (A:PAS061)
\end{exe}

Used with abstract nouns it can encode a~whole range of meanings, some of them probably shading out into idiomatic expressions. The more common ones denote the topic of an~utterance `on, about, concerning', a~reason for something to happen `due to, with that', as in (\ref{ex:7-61}), or the means or attitude by which something is carried out.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-61}
\gll lhooméi [teeṇíi mákar-a ǰhulí] [askúun-a báandi] kuheé díi nikhéet-i \\
fox \textsc{refl} cunning-\textsc{ob} on ease-\textsc{ob}  on well.\textsc{ob} from appear.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `The fox easily got out of the well due to his own cunning.' (B:FOX)
\end{exe}

The reason reading is also the usual when \textit{ǰhulí} takes a~Verbal Noun as its argument (\sectref{subsec:13-4-3}).


In this abstract usage, another postpostion, \textit{báandi}, also in (\ref{ex:7-61}), a~loan from Pashto, is alternatively used, particularly in A.


Some arguments with \textit{ǰhulí} are part of the valence pattern of some predicates, particularly non"=nominative experiencers and objects of some conjunct verbs (\sectref{subsec:12-2-6} and \sectref{subsec:12-2-8} respectively).


\spitzmarke{\textit{maǰí} `among, in, inside, during'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument in its spatial (and temporal) sense `in, into, inside', an~animate oblique plural nominal or accusative plural argument in the sense `among, out of', whereas the oblique form is used when its temporal sense is expressed with a~pronoun. 


One of the basic uses of \textit{maǰí} is to single somebody out as part of a~group, as in example (\ref{ex:7-62}), `of them' or `among them'. The argument taken is always a~plural entity or a~collective expression.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-62}
\gll [tanaám maǰí] áak míiš muṭ-á ǰe ukh-áai bhóo de \\
\textsc{3pl.acc} among one man tree-\textsc{ob} up ascend-\textsc{inf}  be.able.\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `Of them only one man was able to climb the tree.' (A:UNF007)
\end{exe}

The other basic use of this postposition is to express a~position inside of something, the `bazaar' in (\ref{ex:7-63}), often in a~certain geographical location.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-63}
\gll a ɣaríb méeš [baazúur-a maǰí] teeṇíi kuṇaák bhanǰ-úu de \\
\textsc{idef} poor man bazaar-\textsc{ob} in \textsc{refl} child beat-\textsc{3sg} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `A poor man was beating his own child in [the middle of] the bazaar.' (B:ANG002)
\end{exe}

It is also used for the movement of something `into' another something.


As mentioned above, \textit{maǰí} can also be used in a~temporal sense, `while, at, during', with an~oblique pronoun such as in (\ref{ex:7-64}), a~nominal time expression or a~Verbal Noun (\sectref{subsec:13-4-1}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-64}
\gll [tíi maǰí] áak ǰhaṭíl-u ṭhaaṭáaku yhóol-u \\
\textsc{3sg.ob} at \textsc{idef} hairy-\textsc{msg} monster come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Meanwhile a~hairy monster came in.' (A:THA005)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{túuri} `under, beneath, below'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument, e.g. the `deodar tree' in (\ref{ex:7-65}), or an~accusative (or alternatively oblique) pronominal argument. It describes a~position which is in a~purely spatial sense the opposite to that of \textit{ǰhulí} but does not seem to have any other non"=spatial or abstract semantic extensions, and it is not particularly frequent in my data. It typically expresses the position in or the movement into a~position lower than or beneath something.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-65}
\gll karáaṛu [se loomuṭ-á túuri] yeyí ba \\
leopard \textsc{def} deodar.tree-\textsc{ob} under come.\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} \\
\glt `The leopard got in under the deodar tree.' (B:CLE357)
\end{exe}

Either an~oblique or an~accusative pronoun can be taken as an~argument of this postposition referring to an~inanimate entity, the former exemplified in (\ref{ex:7-66}), and the latter in (\ref{ex:7-67}). Whether this reflects a~dialectal difference or is just an~example of free variation, is a~matter for further study.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-66}
\gll karáaṛu [tíi túuri] bheš-í hín-u \\
leopard \textsc{3sg.ob} under sit.down-\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs"=msg } \\
\glt `The leopard had sat down under it [the tree].' (B:SHB749)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-67}
\gll dharíit-u tasíi so wíi tas ba anɡóor-a ǰhulí čhoor-í ba
khaṭúur-a d-áan-a [tas túuri] \\
remain.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \textsc{3sg.gn} \textsc{dem.msg.nom} water \textsc{3sg.acc} \textsc{prt}  fire-\textsc{ob} on put-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} log-\textsc{pl} give-\textsc{prs"=mpl } \textsc{3sg.acc} under   \\
\glt `The remaing water is heated over fire, putting logs under it.' (A:KEE048)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{wée} `in, on, into'.} This spatial postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument or an~oblique pronominal argument. It is exclusively used as a~postposition of nouns or pronouns with inanimate referents. In most cases it signals contact with the surface of something, as the fruit put into the bag in (\ref{ex:7-68}), or the penetration into a~location or beneath the surface of an~object, such as the hunter sitting in the tree in (\ref{ex:7-69}), i.e. inside the structure of tree branches. This latter characterisation is basically what differentiates it from the locative use of the oblique case of a~noun or a~locative pro"=adverb as well as the use of the goal"=specific postposition \textit{the} with a~noun. It seems, however, that many locative nominal expressions can occur almost interchangeably as oblique nouns and as nouns followed by \textit{wée}. Perhaps the postposition serves a~function of further emphasising the locative reading, especially when a~movement is implied.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-68}
\gll tíi so meewá samaṭ-í ba [booǰée wée] de wheelíl-u \\
\textsc{3sg.ob} \textsc{def} fruit collect-\textsc{cv} \textsc{prt} bag.\textsc{ob} in  put.\textsc{cv} take.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg } \\
\glt `He collected the fruit, put it into the bag and brought it down [home].' (A:HUB010)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-69}
\gll so iškaarí méeš [muṭ-á wée] hín-u \\
\textsc{def.msg.nom} hunter man tree-\textsc{ob} in be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `The man is in the tree.' (B:CLE375)
\end{exe}

The noun taking this postposition may also be an~abstract entity, such as `our school class' in (\ref{ex:7-70}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-70}
\gll [asíi ǰumeet-í wée] áaṣṭ kuṇaak-á hín-a \\
\textsc{1pl.gn} class-\textsc{ob} in eight child-\textsc{pl}  be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `There are eight children in our class.' (A:OUR010)
\end{exe}


  \spitzmarke{\textit{ǰe} `up (into), up (along)'.} This rather specialised spatial postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument or an~oblique pronominal argument. It is exclusively used with nouns or pronouns with inanimate referents. It is similar to \textit{wée}, in that it signals contact with the surface of something or the penetration into a~location, but it is restricted to an~upward movement, such as that of the hunter making his way up into the tree in (\ref{ex:7-71}), and it occurs mostly with verbs having a~connotation of upward movement. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-71}
\gll hasó iškaarí ba bhíilam-e [loomuṭ-á ǰe] huṇṭráak ukháat-u \\
\textsc{rem.msg.nom} hunter \textsc{prt} fear-\textsc{gn}  deodar.tree-\textsc{ob} up upward come.up.\textsc{pfv"=msg} \\
\glt `Due to fear, that hunter climbed into a~deodar tree.' (B:CLE357)
\end{exe}

It seems that this postposition primarily has a~connotation of movement, but there are examples of it being used in a~static sense as well.


\spitzmarke{\textit{thíi} `from'.} This spatial postposition takes a~genitive nominal argument, whereas there is no evidence for any pronominal form occurring with it. It is exclusively used with inanimate nouns (and as a~directional specifier of spatial adverbs, see \sectref{subsec:7-1-2}) and is in many ways used interchangeably with a~locative nominal expression in the genitive case. However, it may serve a~function of emphasising the movement away from (as it does when used with certain adverbs), whether in a~concrete spatial sense, as in (\ref{ex:7-72}), or in an~extended temporal sense, as in (\ref{ex:7-73}), although the latter is not very common.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-72}
\gll eé wíi tu xu [sóon"=ii thíi] wh-áand-u \\
oh water \textsc{2sg.nom} \textsc{prt} pasture-\textsc{gn} from  come.down-\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `Oh water, you are obviously coming down from the pastures.' (A:SHY047)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-73}
\gll rhoošnaám [waxt-íi thíi] be c̣híitr-a be kráam th-íia  \\
morning  time-\textsc{gn} from \textsc{1pl.nom} field-\textsc{ob} go.\textsc{cv} work do-\textsc{1pl} \\
\glt `Let's go to the field early in the morning and work.' (A:WOM474)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{khúna/kéeči} `(near) to, with'.} These two synomymous postpositions take an~oblique nominal argument (\ref{ex:7-75}) or an~accusative pronominal argument (\ref{ex:7-74}). They are almost exclusively postposed to nouns or pronouns with animate (and particularly human) referents. It can describe the position `near to, at, with' as well as the movement `(near) to'. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-74}
\gll amzarái [tas khúna] yhóol-u hín-u \\
lion \textsc{3sg.acc} near.to come.\textsc{pfv"=msg } be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `The lion approached him.' (A:UNF013)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-75}
\gll tusím [lúuɡ-a míiš-a kéeči] ma baasaá míi bheezatí thawéel-i \\
\textsc{2pl.erg} strange-\textsc{ob} man-\textsc{ob} with \textsc{1sg.nom} spend.night.\textsc{cv} \textsc{1sg.gn} disgrace cause.to.do.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `You disgraced me by making me spend the night with a~stranger.' (A:UXW051)
\end{exe}

In the directional meaning, \textit{khúna/kéeči} may also be followed by \textit{the} `to' in a~postpositional sequence (see \sectref{subsec:7-2-4}).


\spitzmarke{\textit{šíiṭi} `in, inside'.} This postposition also used as a~spatial adverb (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-2}) takes an~oblique nominal argument or an~oblique pronominal argument. It is exclusively postposed to nouns or pronouns with inanimate referents, particularly those denoting enclosed areas or places, such as the `house' in (\ref{ex:7-76}). It can describe the position `in, inside' as well as the movement `into, inside'.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-76}
\gll [aní ɡhooṣṭ-á šíiṭi] ma seé hín-u  \\
\textsc{prox} house-\textsc{ob}  inside \textsc{1sg.nom} sleep.\textsc{cv} be.\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `Inside this house I was asleep.' (A:HUA014-5)
\end{exe}

In the directional meaning, \textit{šíiṭi} may also be followed by \textit{the} in a~postpositional sequence (\sectref{subsec:7-2-4}).


\spitzmarke{\textit{pharé} (\textit{B.} \textit{phará}) `along, through, across, over'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument or an~oblique pronominal argument. It is exclusively used as a~postposition of nouns or pronouns with inanimate referents. It expresses an~outstretched contact of one entity with the surface of another entity or that the two are located parallel to one another. Typically this is the way of expressing path, as in (\ref{ex:7-77}).

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-77}
\gll hazrát iisá aleehi"=salaám eesé páand-a pharé biáan-u \\
Lord Isa peace.be.upon.him \textsc{rem} path-\textsc{ob} along go.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `Lord Isa [Jesus] (PBUH) came walking along that path.' (A:ABO033)
\end{exe}

However, this postposition can capture a~number of slightly different, but still related, positions and movements, such as the bread put on the mouth of the dead man in example (\ref{ex:7-78}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-78}
\gll tas mheer-í ɡal-í zaalim"=aan-óom [dhút-a pharé] ɡúuli bi de ɡíia de \\
\textsc{3sg.acc} kill-\textsc{cv} throw-\textsc{cv} brute-\textsc{pl"=ob} mouth-\textsc{ob} toward bread also put.\textsc{cv} go.\textsc{pfv.pl} \textsc{pst} \\
\glt `The brutes, who had killed him, had also put bread in his mouth and left.' (A:GHA076-7)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{dúši/ḍáḍi} `toward, at, in the direction of'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument or an~accusative pronominal argument if animate and an~oblique argument if inanimate/locative. While \textit{dúši} is used in A. as well as in B., \textit{ḍáḍi} seems to be most common in B. It is used with nouns or pronouns with human or animate referents as well as with locative expressions, such as the `village' in (\ref{ex:7-79}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-79}
\gll [díiš-a dúši] tilíl-i hín-i \\
village-\textsc{ob} toward walk.\textsc{pfv-f} be.\textsc{prs-f} \\
\glt `She started to walk toward the village.' (A:KAT085)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{maxadúši} (B. \textit{muxadúši}) `before, in front of'.} This diachronically complex postposition (with the above introduced \textit{dúši} as one of its components) is also used as an~adverb. It takes a~genitive argument, \textit{kuṇaak-íi} in (\ref{ex:7-80}), which in most cases has a~human referent. The relation expressed is commonly of an~abstract kind.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-80}
\gll [kuṇaak-íi] maxadúši šóo kráam ta th"=eenḍeéu \\
child-\textsc{gn}  in.front.of good.\textsc{msg} work \textsc{prt} do-\textsc{oblg} \\
\glt `One should act properly in front of children.' (A:SMO022)
\end{exe}

For temporal precedence a~compound postposition \textit{díi muṣṭú/díi muxáak} `before' is used (\sectref{subsec:7-2-3}).


\spitzmarke{\textit{patú} `after, behind'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal argument, as in (\ref{ex:7-81}), or an~accusative pronominal argument. While the same word is almost exclusively used as a~subordinate conjunction in B. (corresponding to \textit{pahúrta} in A.), it primarily expresses a~spatial relationship in A. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-81}
\gll pal-í [áak ṭómb-a patú] \\
hide-\textsc{cv} \textsc{idef} trunk-\textsc{ob} behind \\
\glt `Hiding behind a~tree trunk...' (A:HUA072)
\end{exe}

It is also used in the sense of being `in the pursuit of' something.


\spitzmarke{\textit{tií} `until, up to, as far as'.} This postposition takes an~oblique nominal (and inanimate) argument, `knees' in (\ref{ex:7-83}), or, if referring to a~point in time or space, a~locative spatial adverb, as seen with \textit{eeṛáa} in (\ref{ex:7-82}). It shows that something extends to a~specific point in space or time. 

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-82}
\gll [eeṛáa tií] ta máa-the šiǰrá páta náin-u \\
there.\textsc{dist} up.to \textsc{prt} \textsc{1sg.nom}-to line knowledge \textsc{neg}.be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `I don't know his line until that point.' (A:ASH015)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-83}
\gll heewand-á [khúṭ-am tií] kir d-áan-u \\
winter-\textsc{ob} knee-\textsc{ob.pl} as.far.as snow give-\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `In the winter the snow reaches up to the knees.' (B:DHN4628)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{dapáara} (A.)/\textit{pándee} (B.) `for'.} This postposition, which expresses purpose (if inanimate) or beneficiary (if human), takes a~genitive argument. The beneficiary use can be seen in (\ref{ex:7-84}).

\begin{exe}

When a~purpose is expressed pronominally, it is the form of the pro"=adverb that expresses a~movement from a~location (i.e. an~ablative) that is being used, e.g. \textit{eeṛáai} (\ref{ex:7-85}) in A., or \textit{hatáawuu} (\ref{ex:7-86}) in B.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-85}
\gll [eeṛáai dapáara] muxtalíf muxtalíf teeṇteeṇíi saamaán hín-i \\
from.there.\textsc{dist} for different different \textsc{refl}  things be.\textsc{prs-f}  \\
\glt `For that a~lot of different things are needed.' (A:HOW018)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-86}
\gll súun-a the [hatáawuu pándee] har-áan-a \\
pasture-\textsc{ob} to from.there for take.away-\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `That's why we take them to the pastures.' (B:SHC015)
\end{exe}

The postposition \textit{dapáara/pándee} may also take as an~argument a~Verbal Noun in a~purpose clause, (see \sectref{subsec:13-4-2}).


\subsection{Compound postpositions}
\label{subsec:7-2-3}

Compound postpositions are phrases consisting of one of the simple directional postpositions, \textit{díi} `from, of' and \textit{the} `to', followed by an~adverb. Although this list probably is far from exhaustive, this postpositional type does not seem to be extremely common in Palula. 

\spitzmarke{\textit{the nhiáaṛa} `close to, next to'.}

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-87}
\gll milikc̣heétr thaní [ɡhróom-a the nhiáaṛa] áak c̣híitr hín-u \\
Milikchetre call.\textsc{cv} village-\textsc{ob} to near \textsc{idef} field be.\textsc{prs"=msg} \\
\glt `Close to the village there is a~field called Milikchetre.' (A:JAN029)
\end{exe}

The adverb component in the compound can be further modified, such modifications, in (\ref{ex:7-88}) \textit{tuúš bi}, occurring between the adverb and the simple postposition.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-88}
\gll se [wíi-a the tuúš bi nhiáaṛa] ɡíi hín-i \\
\textsc{def} water-\textsc{ob} to a.little also near go.\textsc{pfv.f} be.\textsc{prs-f} \\
\glt `She went a~bit closer to the water.' (A:SHY054)
\end{exe}

If the argument is human, e.g. `me' in (\ref{ex:7-89}), a~compound \textit{keeči the nhiáaṛa}, consisting of a~postpositional sequence (\sectref{subsec:7-2-4}) and an~adverb, is used.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-89}
\gll [ma kéeči the nhiáaṛa] bheš \\
\textsc{1sg.nom} with to near sit.down.\textsc{imp.sg} \\
\glt `Sit down next to me!' (A:AYB029)
\end{exe}

\spitzmarke{\textit{díi muṣṭú/muxáak/maxadúši} `before, prior to'.}

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-90}
\gll eeṛáa díi bi qaríban bhiš kaal-á maxadúši \\
there.\textsc{dist} from also about twenty year-\textsc{pl} in.front.of \\
\glt `About 20 years prior to this...' (A:GHA048)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-91}
\gll asíi dóodu c̣oók [kaṭur-á díi dúu sóo kaal-á muṣṭú] yhóol-u
hín-u \\
\textsc{1pl.gn} grandfather Choke Kator-\textsc{ob} from two hundred year-\textsc{pl} before come.\textsc{pfv"=msg} be.\textsc{prs"=msg}  \\
\glt `Our ancestor Choke arrived two hundred years prior to the Kator [dynasty].' (A:ASH047)
\end{exe}

The compound \textit{díi muṣṭú/muxáak} also occurs with Verbal Nouns in temporal subordination (\sectref{subsec:13-4-1}). 


\spitzmarke{díi dhuúra `far from, away from'.}

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-92}
\gll taníi c̣íitr ba [taníi ɡhooṣṭ-á díi taqríiban tróo čúur
  kulumiṭer-á dhuúra] de \\
\textsc{3pl.gn} field \textsc{prt} \textsc{3pl.gn} house-\textsc{ob} from about three four kilometre-\textsc{pl} away.from be.\textsc{pst}  \\
\glt `Their field was about three to four kilometres away from their house.' (A:WOM468)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Postpositional sequences}
\label{subsec:7-2-4}

Another kind of complex postposition consists of a~sequence of two simple postpositions. The first in the sequence is the semantically more central one, whereas the second is a~further fine"=tuning or specification, usually as far as the direction is concerned. Exactly which postpositions can and which cannot be combined in this fashion is a~matter of further research; (\ref{ex:7-93})--(\ref{ex:7-98}) are only a~few illustrative examples.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-93}
\gll [ḍukur-á šíiṭi the] ɡhin-í ɡíia hín-a \\
hut-\textsc{ob} inside to take-\textsc{cv} go.\textsc{pfv.pl} be.\textsc{prs"=mpl} \\
\glt `They took him inside the hut.' (A:KAT062)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-94}
\gll so kuṇaák [se ṭhaaṭaak-a khúna the] ɡúum \\
\textsc{def.msg.nom} child \textsc{def} monster-\textsc{ob} near to go.\textsc{pfv.msg} \\
\glt `The child went over to the monster.' (A:BER003)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-95}
\gll [tasíi šan-á ǰhulí the] wháat-u \\
\textsc{3sg.gn} roof-\textsc{ob} on to come.down.\textsc{pfv"=msg}  \\
\glt `I got down to the roof of his house.' (A:HUA091)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-96}
\gll aakatí kasaán nikháat-a [ɡiḍ-á dúšii \textmd{thíi]} \\
some persons appear.\textsc{pfv"=mpl} Damel-\textsc{ob} toward.\textsc{gn} from \\
\glt `A few people came down, from the direction of Damel.' (A:JAN043)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-97}
\gll ɡulsambér ɡhambúri-m-e bhéṭi wíi [tesée muxadúši phará]
wheelíl-i \\
forest.flower flower-\textsc{pl"=gn} bouquet water \textsc{3sg.gn} in.front.of along bring.down.\textsc{pfv-f} \\
\glt `The water brought down a~bouquet of forest flowers in front of her.' (B:FLW805)
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\label{ex:7-98}
\gll \label{bkm:Ref193771773}[ǰeep-í wée yúu] se ɡhambúri-m ɡhaḍíl-im \\
pocket-\textsc{ob} in from \textsc{def} flower-\textsc{pl}  take.out.\textsc{pfv"=fpl} \\
\glt `He brought out the flowers from inside his pocket.' (B:FLW794)
\end{exe}

It should be noted that the noun preceding the postpositional sequence is regularly assigned case by the first component of the sequence. The (nominally derived) postposition \textit{dúši}, itself assigning oblique case to the preceding noun in (\ref{ex:7-96}), receives genitive marking from the second postposiion \textit{thíi}.


The second component in the sequence \textit{wée yúu} in (\ref{ex:7-98}) does not occur as an~independent postposition but is certainly related to the ablative function of this particular segment \textit{(y)uu/w(uu)} occurring in a~few spatial expressions, especially in the B. variety: \textit{hatáa-(w)uu} `from there', \textit{aṛáa-(y)uu} `from there', \textit{índee-(y)uu} `from here', \textit{ɡóo-(y)uu} `from where', but also as \textit{-oo} in some temporal adverbs in A. (see \sectref{subsec:7-1-3} above). \citeauthor{schmidtkohistani2001} mention a~rare ablative suffix \textit{-nyuu$\sim$nuu$\sim$uu} in Kohistani Shina with a~very similar distribution (\citeyear[130]{schmidtkohistani2001}).
